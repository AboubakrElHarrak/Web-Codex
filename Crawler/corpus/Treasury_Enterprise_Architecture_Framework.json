By grounding the architecture in the business of the organization, the TEAF defines the core business procedures and enterprise processes.

An Enterprise Architecture formalizes the identification, documentation, and management of these interrelationships, and supports the management and decision processes. The Enterprise Architecture provides substantial support for evolution of an enterprise as it anticipates and responds to the changing needs of its customers and constituents. The Enterprise Architecture is a vital part of the enterprise's decision-making process, and will evolve along with the enterprise's mission.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The TEAF has been designed to help both the bureaus and the Department develop and maintain their Enterprise Architectures. The TEAF aims to establish a common Enterprise Architecture structure, consistent practices, and common terminology; and to institutionalize Enterprise Architecture governance across the Department.

To reduce the complexity and scope of developing and using an Enterprise Architecture, it must be subdivided so that portions may be used independently or built incrementally in separate projects. The TEAF subdivides an Enterprise Architecture by:\n",

The resources and work products for EA direction and accomplishment are not part of the EA description itself, but are developed and applied during the overall enterprise life cycle. The TEAF Matri,  organizes the subdivisions of the EA description and demonstrates the relationships among them.

The TEAF Matrix aims to provide a simple, uniform structure to an entire framework. As depicted in the figure, the TEAF Matrix consists of four architectural views (Functional, Information, Organizational, and Infrastructure), which are shown as columns, and four perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, and Builder), which appear as rows. The TEAF Matrix is a four-by-four matrix with a total of 16 cells.  The views and perspectives are described in the following sections.\n",
            "paragraph6": "When an EA description work product is shown within one cell of the TEAF Matrix, it means that the main vantage points for developing that work product correspond to that column (view) and row (perspective).  However, information from other views (and sometimes other perspectives) is needed to produce a work product.  Not all cells must be \"filled-in\" by producing an associated work product. Each bureau must define in its EA Roadmap its plans for producing and using an EA to match its needs.\n",

Enterprise Life Cycle refers generally to an organization's approach for managing activities and making decisions during ongoing refreshment of business and technical practices to support its enterprise mission. These activities include investment management, project definition, configuration management, accountability, and guidance for systems development according to a System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The Enterprise Life Cycle applies to enterprise-wide planning activities and decision making. By contrast, a System Development Life Cycle generally refers to practices for building individual systems. Determining what systems to build is an enterprise-level decision.\n",

Within the context of this document, Enterprise Life Cycle does not refer to a specific methodology or a specific bureau's approach.

It describes the enterprise information systems architecture and its components, including the architecture’s purpose, benefits, characteristics, and structure. The TEAF introduces various architectural views and delineates several modeling techniques. Each view is supported with graphics, data repositories, matrices, or reports (i.e., architectural products).\n",
            "paragraph10": "The figure shows a matrix with four views and four perspectives. Essential products are shown across the top two rows of the matrix. It is notable that the TEAF includes an Information Assurance Trust model, the Technical Reference Model, and standards profiles as essential work products. These are not often addressed as critical\nframework components. One of these frameworks should provide a means to logically structure and organize the selected EA products. Now, in order to effectively create and maintain the EA products, a toolset should be selected.\n",

The Node Connectivity Description for a given architecture shows nodes (not always defined in physical terms), while the System Interface Description depicts the systems corresponding to the system nodes.  The System Interface Description can be produced at four levels, as described below. Level 1 is an essential work product, while Levels 2, 3, and 4 are supporting work products.\n",
            "paragraph12": "The System Interface Description identifies the interfaces between nodes, between systems, and between the components of a system, depending on the needs of a particular architecture. A system interface is a simplified or generalized representation of a communications pathway or network, usually depicted graphically as a straight line, with a descriptive label.  Often, pairs of connected systems or system components have multiple interfaces between them.  The System Interface Description depicts all interfaces between systems and/or system components that are of interest to the architect.\n",
            "paragraph13": "The graphic descriptions and/or supporting text for the System Interface Description should provide details concerning the capabilities of each system.  For example, descriptions of information systems should include details concerning the applications present within the system, the infrastructure services that support the applications, and the means by which the system processes, manipulates, stores, and exchanges data.\n"
