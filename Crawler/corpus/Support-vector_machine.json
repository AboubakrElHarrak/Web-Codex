            "paragraph1": "In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995,  Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
            "paragraph3": "When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support-vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed]\n"

In the case of support-vector machines, a data point is viewed as a \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n-dimensional vector (a list of \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a \n\n\n\n(\np\n−\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (p-1)}\n\n-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum-margin classifier; or equivalently, the perceptron of optimal stability.[citation needed]\n"

            "paragraph1": "More formally, a support-vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outliers detection. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin, the lower the generalization error of the classifier.\n",

            "paragraph2": "Whereas the original problem may be stated in a finite-dimensional space, it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much higher-dimensional space, presumably making the separation easier in that space. To keep the computational load reasonable, the mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products of pairs of input data vectors may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space, by defining them in terms of a kernel function \n\n\n\nk\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k(x,y)}\n\n selected to suit the problem. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant, where such a set of vectors is an orthogonal (and thus minimal) set of vectors that defines a hyperplane. The vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters \n\n\n\n\nα\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha _{i))\n\n of images of feature vectors \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i))\n\n that occur in the data base. With this choice of a hyperplane, the points \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation \n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\ni\n\n\n\nα\n\ni\n\n\nk\n(\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n,\nx\n)\n=\n\nconstant\n\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{i}\\alpha _{i}k(x_{i},x)={\\text{constant)).}\n\n  Note that if \n\n\n\nk\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k(x,y)}\n\n becomes small as \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n grows further away from \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n, each term in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n to the corresponding data base point \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i))\n\n. In this way, the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated. Note the fact that the set of points \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result, allowing much more complex discrimination between sets that are not convex at all in the original space.\n"

This is also true for image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik.[10][11]\nClassification of satellite data like SAR data using supervised SVM.[12]\nHand-written characters can be recognized using SVM.[13][14]\nThe SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences.  They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. Permutation tests based on SVM weights have been suggested as a mechanism for interpretation of SVM models.[15][16] Support-vector machine weights have also been used to interpret SVM models in the past.[17] Posthoc interpretation of support-vector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences.\n"

            "subtitle6": "Bayesian SVM",
            "paragraph15": "In 2011 it was shown by Polson and Scott that the SVM admits a Bayesian interpretation through the technique of data augmentation. In this approach the SVM is viewed as a graphical model (where the parameters are connected via probability distributions). This extended view allows the application of Bayesian techniques to SVMs, such as flexible feature modeling, automatic hyperparameter tuning, and predictive uncertainty quantification. Recently, a scalable version of the Bayesian SVM was developed by Florian Wenzel, enabling the application of Bayesian SVMs to big data. Florian Wenzel developed two different versions, a variational inference (VI) scheme for the Bayesian kernel support vector machine (SVM) and a stochastic version (SVI) for the linear Bayesian SVM.\n"

            "title": "Implementation",
            "paragraph1": "The parameters of the maximum-margin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization. There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises from SVMs, mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Another approach is to use an interior-point method that uses Newton-like iterations to find a solution of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems.\nInstead of solving a sequence of broken-down problems, this approach directly solves the problem altogether. To avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix, a low-rank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Another common method is Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, which breaks the problem down into 2-dimensional sub-problems that are solved analytically, eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm and matrix storage. This algorithm is conceptually simple, easy to implement, generally faster, and has better scaling properties for difficult SVM problems.\n",
            "paragraph4": "The special case of linear support-vector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin, logistic regression; this class of algorithms includes sub-gradient descent (e.g., PEGASOS) and coordinate descent (e.g., LIBLINEAR). LIBLINEAR has some attractive training-time properties. Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data, and the iterations also have a Q-linear convergence property, making the algorithm extremely fast.\n",
            "paragraph5": "The general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using sub-gradient descent (e.g. P-packSVM), especially when parallelization is allowed.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Kernel SVMs are available in many machine-learning toolkits, including LIBSVM, MATLAB, SAS, SVMlight, kernlab, scikit-learn, Shogun, Weka, Shark, JKernelMachines, OpenCV and others.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Preprocessing of data (standardization) is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of classification. There are a few methods of standardization, such as min-max, normalization by decimal scaling, Z-score. Subtraction of mean and division by variance of each feature is usually used for SVM.\n"
