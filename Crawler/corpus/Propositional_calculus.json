            "paragraph1": "Propositional calculus is a branch of logic.  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Explanation",
            "paragraph1": "Logical connectives are found in natural languages. In English for example, some examples are \"and\" (conjunction), \"or\" (disjunction),  \"not\" (negation) and \"if\" (but only when used to denote material conditional).\n",
            "paragraph2": "The following is an example of a very simple inference within the scope of propositional logic:\n",
            "paragraph3": "Both premises and the conclusion are propositions. The premises are taken for granted, and with the application of modus ponens (an inference rule), the conclusion follows.\n",
            "paragraph4": "As propositional logic is not concerned with the structure of propositions beyond the point where they can't be decomposed any more by logical connectives, this inference can be restated replacing those atomic statements with statement letters, which are interpreted as variables representing statements:\n",
            "paragraph5": "The same can be stated succinctly in the following way:\n",
            "paragraph6": "When P is interpreted as \"It's raining\" and Q as \"it's cloudy\" the above symbolic expressions can be seen to correspond exactly with the original expression in natural language. Not only that, but they will also correspond with any other inference of this form, which will be valid on the same basis this inference is.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Propositional logic may be studied through a formal system in which formulas of a formal language may be interpreted to represent propositions. A system of axioms and inference rules allows certain formulas to be derived. These derived formulas are called theorems and may be interpreted to be true propositions. A constructed sequence of such formulas is known as a derivation or proof and the last formula of the sequence is the theorem. The derivation may be interpreted as proof of the proposition represented by the theorem.\n",
            "paragraph8": "When a formal system is used to represent formal logic, only statement letters (usually capital roman letters such as \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n, \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q}\n\n and \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n) are represented directly. The natural language propositions that arise when they're interpreted are outside the scope of the system, and the relation between the formal system and its interpretation is likewise outside the formal system itself.\n",
            "paragraph9": "In classical truth-functional propositional logic, formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, the truth value of true or the truth value of false. The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld. Truth-functional propositional logic defined as such and systems isomorphic to it are considered to be zeroth-order logic. However, alternative propositional logics are also possible. For more, see Other logical calculi below.\n"

        {
            "title": "History",
            "paragraph1": "Although propositional logic (which is interchangeable with propositional calculus) had been hinted by earlier philosophers, it was developed into a formal logic (Stoic logic) by Chrysippus in the 3rd century BC and expanded by his successor Stoics. The logic was focused on propositions. This advancement was different from the traditional syllogistic logic, which was focused on terms. However, most of the original writings were lost and the propositional logic developed by the Stoics was no longer understood later in antiquity.[citation needed] Consequently, the system was essentially reinvented by Peter Abelard in the 12th century.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Propositional logic was eventually refined using symbolic logic. The 17th/18th-century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz has been credited with being the founder of symbolic logic for his work with the calculus ratiocinator. Although his work was the first of its kind, it was unknown to the larger logical community. Consequently, many of the advances achieved by Leibniz were recreated by logicians like George Boole and Augustus De Morgan—completely independent of Leibniz.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Just as propositional logic can be considered an advancement from the earlier syllogistic logic, Gottlob Frege's predicate logic can be also considered an advancement from the earlier propositional logic. One author describes predicate logic as combining \"the distinctive features of syllogistic logic and propositional logic.\" Consequently, predicate logic ushered in a new era in logic's history; however, advances in propositional logic were still made after Frege, including natural deduction, truth trees and truth tables. Natural deduction was invented by Gerhard Gentzen and Jan Łukasiewicz. Truth trees were invented by Evert Willem Beth. The invention of truth tables, however, is of uncertain attribution.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Within works by Frege and Bertrand Russell, are ideas influential to the invention of truth tables. The actual tabular structure (being formatted as a table), itself, is generally credited to either Ludwig Wittgenstein or Emil Post (or both, independently). Besides Frege and Russell, others credited with having ideas preceding truth tables include Philo, Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ernst Schröder. Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred North Whitehead, William Stanley Jevons, John Venn, and Clarence Irving Lewis. Ultimately, some have concluded, like John Shosky, that \"It is far from clear that any one person should be given the title of 'inventor' of truth-tables.\".\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Terminology",
            "paragraph1": "In general terms, a calculus is a formal system that consists of a set of syntactic expressions (well-formed formulas), a distinguished subset of these expressions (axioms), plus a set of formal rules that define a specific binary relation, intended to be interpreted as logical equivalence, on the space of expressions.\n",
            "paragraph2": "When the formal system is intended to be a logical system, the expressions are meant to be interpreted as statements, and the rules, known to be inference rules, are typically intended to be truth-preserving. In this setting, the rules, which may include axioms, can then be used to derive (\"infer\") formulas representing true statements—from given formulas representing true statements.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The set of axioms may be empty, a nonempty finite set, or a countably infinite set (see axiom schema). A formal grammar recursively defines the expressions and well-formed formulas of the language. In addition a semantics may be given which defines truth and valuations (or interpretations).\n",
            "paragraph4": "The language of a propositional calculus consists of\n",
            "ol1": "1 - a set of primitive symbols, variously referred to as atomic formulas, placeholders, proposition letters, or variables, and\n2 - a set of operator symbols, variously interpreted as logical operators or logical connectives.\n",
            "paragraph5": "A well-formed formula is any atomic formula, or any formula that can be built up from atomic formulas by means of operator symbols according to the rules of the grammar.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Mathematicians sometimes distinguish between propositional constants, propositional variables, and schemata. Propositional constants represent some particular proposition, while propositional variables range over the set of all atomic propositions.  Schemata, however, range over all propositions. It is common to represent propositional constants by A, B, and C, propositional variables by P, Q, and R, and schematic letters are often Greek letters, most often φ, ψ, and χ.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Basic concepts",
            "paragraph1": "The following outlines a standard propositional calculus. Many different formulations exist which are all more or less equivalent, but differ in the details of:\n",
            "ol1": "1 - their language (i.e., the particular collection of primitive symbols and operator symbols),\n2 - the set of axioms, or distinguished formulas, and\n3 - the set of inference rules.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Any given proposition may be represented with a letter called a 'propositional constant', analogous to representing a number by a letter in mathematics (e.g., a = 5). All propositions require exactly one of two truth-values:  true or false. For example, let P be the proposition that it is raining outside. This will be true (P) if it is raining outside, and false otherwise (¬P).\n",
            "ul1": "We then define truth-functional operators, beginning with negation.  ¬P represents the negation of P, which can be thought of as the denial of P.  In the example above, ¬P expresses that it is not raining outside, or by a more standard reading: \"It is not the case that it is raining outside.\"  When P is true, ¬P is false; and when P is false, ¬P is true. As a result, ¬ ¬P always has the same truth-value as P.\nConjunction is a truth-functional connective which forms a proposition out of two simpler propositions, for example, P and Q.  The conjunction of P and Q is written P ∧ Q, and expresses that each are true.  We read P ∧ Q as \"P and Q\".  For any two propositions, there are four possible assignments of truth values:\nP is true and Q is true\nP is true and Q is false\nP is false and Q is true\nP is false and Q is false\nP is true and Q is true\nP is true and Q is false\nP is false and Q is true\nP is false and Q is false\n",
            "ul2": "Disjunction resembles conjunction in that it forms a proposition out of two simpler propositions.  We write it P ∨ Q, and it is read \"P or Q\".  It expresses that either P or Q is true. Thus, in the cases listed above, the disjunction of P with Q is true in all cases—except case 4. Using the example above, the disjunction expresses that it is either raining outside, or there is a cold front over Kansas. (Note, this use of disjunction is supposed to resemble the use of the English word \"or\".  However, it is most like the English inclusive \"or\", which can be used to express the truth of at least one of two propositions.  It is not like the English exclusive \"or\", which expresses the truth of exactly one of two propositions. In other words, the exclusive \"or\" is false when both P and Q are true (case 1). An example of the exclusive or is: You may have a bagel or a pastry, but not both. Often in natural language, given the appropriate context, the addendum \"but not both\" is omitted—but implied. In mathematics, however, \"or\" is always inclusive or; if exclusive or is meant it will be specified, possibly by \"xor\".)\nMaterial conditional also joins two simpler propositions, and we write P → Q, which is read \"if P then Q\".  The proposition to the left of the arrow is called the antecedent, and the proposition to the right is called the consequent. (There is no such designation for conjunction or disjunction, since they are commutative operations.) It expresses that Q is true whenever P is true. Thus P → Q is true in every case above except case 2, because this is the only case when P is true but Q is not. Using the example, if P then Q expresses that if it is raining outside, then there is a cold-front over Kansas. The material conditional is often confused with physical causation. The material conditional, however, only relates two propositions by their truth-values—which is not the relation of cause and effect. It is contentious in the literature whether the material implication represents logical causation.\nBiconditional joins two simpler propositions, and we write P ↔ Q, which is read \"P if and only if Q\". It expresses that P and Q have the same truth-value, and in cases 1 and 4. 'P is true if and only if Q' is true, and is false otherwise.\n",
            "paragraph3": "It is very helpful to look at the truth tables for these different operators, as well as the method of analytic tableaux.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Closure under operations",
            "paragraph4": "Propositional logic is closed under truth-functional connectives.  That is to say, for any proposition φ, ¬φ is also a proposition.  Likewise, for any propositions φ and ψ, φ ∧ ψ is a proposition, and similarly for disjunction, conditional, and biconditional.  This implies that, for instance, φ ∧ ψ is a proposition, and so it can be conjoined with another proposition.  In order to represent this, we need to use parentheses to indicate which proposition is conjoined with which.  For instance, P ∧ Q ∧ R is not a well-formed formula, because we do not know if we are conjoining P ∧ Q with R or if we are conjoining P with Q ∧ R.  Thus we must write either (P ∧ Q) ∧ R to represent the former, or P ∧ (Q ∧ R) to represent the latter.  By evaluating the truth conditions, we see that both expressions have the same truth conditions (will be true in the same cases), and moreover that any proposition formed by arbitrary conjunctions will have the same truth conditions, regardless of the location of the parentheses.  This means that conjunction is associative, however, one should not assume that parentheses never serve a purpose.  For instance, the sentence P ∧ (Q ∨ R) does not have the same truth conditions of (P ∧ Q) ∨ R, so they are different sentences distinguished only by the parentheses.  One can verify this by the truth-table method referenced above.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Note:  For any arbitrary number of propositional constants, we can form a finite number of cases which list their possible truth-values.  A simple way to generate this is by truth-tables, in which one writes P, Q, ..., Z, for any list of k propositional constants—that is to say, any list of propositional constants with k entries.  Below this list, one writes 2k rows, and below P one fills in the first half of the rows with true (or T) and the second half with false (or F).  Below Q one fills in one-quarter of the rows with T, then one-quarter with F, then one-quarter with T and the last quarter with F.  The next column alternates between true and false for each eighth of the rows, then sixteenths, and so on, until the last propositional constant varies between T and F for each row.  This will give a complete listing of cases or truth-value assignments possible for those propositional constants.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Argument",
            "paragraph6": "The propositional calculus then defines an argument to be a list of propositions.  A valid argument is a list of propositions, the last of which follows from—or is implied by—the rest.  All other arguments are invalid.  The simplest valid argument is modus ponens, one instance of which is the following list of propositions:\n",
            "paragraph7": "This is a list of three propositions, each line is a proposition, and the last follows from the rest.  The first two lines are called premises, and the last line the conclusion. We say that any proposition C follows from any set of propositions \n\n\n\n(\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\nP\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (P_{1},...,P_{n})}\n\n, if C must be true whenever every member of the set \n\n\n\n(\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\nP\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (P_{1},...,P_{n})}\n\n is true.  In the argument above, for any P and Q, whenever P → Q and P are true, necessarily Q is true.  Notice that, when P is true, we cannot consider cases 3 and 4 (from the truth table).  When P → Q is true, we cannot consider case 2.  This leaves only case 1, in which Q is also true.  Thus Q is implied by the premises.\n",
            "paragraph8": "This generalizes schematically.  Thus, where φ and ψ may be any propositions at all,\n",
            "paragraph9": "Other argument forms are convenient, but not necessary.  Given a complete set of axioms (see below for one such set), modus ponens is sufficient to prove all other argument forms in propositional logic, thus they may be considered to be a derivative.  Note, this is not true of the extension of propositional logic to other logics like first-order logic.  First-order logic requires at least one additional rule of inference in order to obtain completeness.\n",
            "paragraph10": "The significance of argument in formal logic is that one may obtain new truths from established truths.  In the first example above, given the two premises, the truth of Q is not yet known or stated.  After the argument is made, Q is deduced.  In this way, we define a deduction system to be a set of all propositions that may be deduced from another set of propositions.  For instance, given the set of propositions \n\n\n\nA\n=\n{\nP\n∨\nQ\n,\n¬\nQ\n∧\nR\n,\n(\nP\n∨\nQ\n)\n→\nR\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A=\\{P\\lor Q,\\neg Q\\land R,(P\\lor Q)\\to R\\))\n\n, we can define a deduction system, Γ, which is the set of all propositions which follow from A. Reiteration is always assumed, so \n\n\n\nP\n∨\nQ\n,\n¬\nQ\n∧\nR\n,\n(\nP\n∨\nQ\n)\n→\nR\n∈\nΓ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P\\lor Q,\\neg Q\\land R,(P\\lor Q)\\to R\\in \\Gamma }\n\n.  Also, from the first element of A, last element, as well as modus ponens, R is a consequence, and so \n\n\n\nR\n∈\nΓ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R\\in \\Gamma }\n\n.  Because we have not included sufficiently complete axioms, though, nothing else may be deduced.  Thus, even though most deduction systems studied in propositional logic are able to deduce \n\n\n\n(\nP\n∨\nQ\n)\n↔\n(\n¬\nP\n→\nQ\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (P\\lor Q)\\leftrightarrow (\\neg P\\to Q)}\n\n, this one is too weak to prove such a proposition.\n"

(For example, we might have a rule telling us that from \"A\" we can derive \"A or B\". In III.a We assume that if A is provable it is implied.

A is provable from G, we assume. So it is also implied by G. So any semantic valuation making all of G true makes A true.

Then combine the lines of the truth table together two at a time by using \"(P is true implies S) implies ((P is false implies S) implies S)\".

Once this is done, there are many advantages to be gained from developing the graphical analogue of the calculus on strings.

(For example, from \"All dogs are mammals\" we may infer \"If Rover is a dog then Rover is a mammal\".) With the tools of first-order logic it is possible to formulate a number of theories, either with explicit axioms or by rules of inference, that can themselves be treated as logical calculi. Arithmetic is the best known of these; others include set theory and mereology. Second-order logic and other higher-order logics are formal extensions of first-order logic.

The translation between modal logics and algebraic logics concerns classical and intuitionistic logics but with the introduction of a unary operator on Boolean or Heyting algebras, different from the Boolean operations, interpreting the possibility modality, and in the case of Heyting algebra a second operator interpreting necessity (for Boolean algebra this is redundant since necessity is the De Morgan dual of possibility). The first operator preserves 0 and disjunction while the second preserves 1 and conjunction.\n",

These logics often require calculational devices quite distinct from propositional calculus.
