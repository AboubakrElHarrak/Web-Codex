He is one of only 24 people to have flown to the Moon, having flown as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 13. He was to have been the sixth person to walk on the Moon, but the Apollo 13 landing mission was aborted en route. \n",

            "paragraph1": "Born on November 14, 1933, and raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, to Fred Wallace Haise Sr. and Lucille (née Blacksher) Haise. He attended Biloxi High School, from which he graduated in 1950, and Perkinston Junior College (now Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College), with original aims of a career in journalism, receiving an Associate of Arts degree in 1952. He was a Boy Scout, earning the rank of Star Scout. Eligible for the draft and despite being apprehensive of flying, he joined the Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD) training program. Haise underwent Naval Aviator training from 1952 to 1954. He served as a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot, with VMF-533 then VMF-114 on the F2H-4 Banshee and F9F-8 Cougar at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina, from March 1954 to September 1956.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Haise has accumulated 9,300 hours flying time, including 6,200 hours in jets.\n",
            "paragraph3": "After his military service, Haise returned to school and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in aeronautical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1959, concurrently serving for two years in the Oklahoma Air National Guard, as a fighter interceptor pilot with the 185th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, flying the F-86D. He then worked for the newly created NASA, first as a research pilot at the Lewis Research Center near Cleveland. His Air National Guard unit was called up during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and he served ten months as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. He was a tactical fighter pilot and chief of the 164th Standardization-Evaluation Flight of the 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Mansfield Lahm Air National Guard Base, Ohio,  flying the F-84F.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Haise completed post-graduate courses at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California in 1964, and attended the six-week Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program in 1972.\n"

He was the first astronaut among his class to be assigned to a mission, serving as backup Lunar Module Pilot for both Apollo 8 and Apollo 11.\n",

            "paragraph2": "Haise flew as the lunar module pilot on the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. Due to the distance between the Earth and Moon during the mission, Haise, Jim Lovell, and Jack Swigert hold the record for the farthest distance from the Earth ever traveled by human beings. During this flight Haise developed a urinary tract infection and later kidney infections. These caused him to be in pain for most of the trip.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Haise was slated to become the sixth human to walk on the Moon during Apollo 13 behind Lovell, who was to be fifth. Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell eventually became the fifth and sixth, respectively, on Apollo 14, which completed Apollo 13's mission to the Fra Mauro formation.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Haise remained in the astronaut rotation and served as the backup mission Commander for Apollo 16. Though there was no formal selection, Haise was prospectively slated to command Apollo 19 with William R. Pogue as command module pilot and Gerald P. Carr as lunar module pilot. However, the mission was canceled in late 1970 due to budget cuts.\n",

            "paragraph5": "After completing his backup assignment on Apollo 16, Haise moved to the Space Shuttle program. In 1977, he participated in the program's Approach and Landing Tests at Edwards Air Force Base. Along with C. Gordon Fullerton as Pilot, Haise as Commander piloted the Space Shuttle Enterprise in free flight to three successful landings after being released from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The tests successfully verified the shuttle's flight characteristics, an important step toward the overall success of the program.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Haise was assigned to command STS-2A, the second Space Shuttle mission, which would have delivered the Teleoperator Retrieval System that would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit, preserving it for future use. Delays in the Shuttle program development as well as an unexpected increase in Skylab's orbital decay led to the mission being canceled. Skylab was destroyed upon entering the Earth's atmosphere in July 1979, while the Space Shuttle did not launch until April 1981.\n",
            "paragraph7": "In June 1979, Haise left NASA to become a test pilot and executive with Grumman Aerospace Corporation, where he remained until retiring in 1996.  He was the only one of the four astronauts who conducted the Enterprise landing tests not to fly in space on the Shuttle.\n"

            "paragraph2": "On August 22, 1973, Haise was piloting a Convair BT-13 belonging to the Commemorative Air Force that had been converted to look like an Aichi D3A \"Val\" torpedo bomber for the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora!.  While attempting a landing go around at Scholes Field in Galveston, Texas an undetermined power plant failure led to a crash landing.  Haise suffered second‐degree burns over 50 percent of his body in the post crash fire.\n"
