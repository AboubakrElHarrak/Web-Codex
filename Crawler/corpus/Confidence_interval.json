            "paragraph1": "In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates for an unknown parameter, defined as an interval with a lower bound and an upper bound (notwithstanding one-sided confidence intervals, which are bounded only on one side). The interval is computed at a designated confidence level. The 95% confidence level is most common, but other levels (such as 90% or 99%) are sometimes used. The confidence level represents the long-run frequency of confidence intervals that contain the true value of the parameter. In other words, 95% of confidence intervals computed at the 95% confidence level contain the parameter, and likewise for other confidence levels.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The factors affecting the width of the CI include the confidence level, the sample size, and the variability in the sample. Larger samples produce narrower confidence intervals when all other factors are equal. Greater variability in the sample produces wider confidence intervals when all other factors are equal. A higher confidence level produces wider confidence intervals when all other factors are equal.\n"

            "paragraph1": "Let X be a random sample from a probability distribution with statistical parameter θ, which is a quantity to be estimated, and φ, representing quantities that are not of immediate interest. A confidence interval for the parameter θ, with confidence level or confidence coefficient γ, is an interval with random endpoints (u(X), v(X)), determined by the pair of random variables u(X) and v(X), with the property:\n",
            "paragraph2": "The number γ, with typical values close to but not greater than 1, is sometimes given in the form 1 − α (or as a percentage 100%·(1 − α)), where α is a small non-negative number, most commonly .05.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Here Prθ,φ indicates the probability distribution of X characterised by (θ, φ). An important part of this specification is that the random interval (u(X), v(X)) covers the unknown value θ with probability γ no matter what the true value of θ actually is. There is no way of knowing whether an individual confidence interval that has been computed covers (includes) θ. However, the procedure guarantees (if statistical assumptions are met) that each time we collect a random sample to estimate a parameter, we have probability γ that the confidence interval we compute will cover θ.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Approximate confidence intervals",
            "paragraph4": "In many applications, confidence intervals that have exactly the required confidence level are hard to construct, but approximate intervals can be computed. The rule for constructing the interval may be accepted as providing a confidence interval at level \n\n\n\nγ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n\n if\n",
            "paragraph5": "to an acceptable level of approximation. Alternatively, some authors simply require that\n",
            "paragraph6": "which is useful if the probabilities are only partially identified or imprecise, and also when dealing with discrete distributions. Confidence limits of form\n",
            "paragraph7": "are called conservative; accordingly, one speaks of conservative confidence intervals and, in general, regions.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Desirable properties",
            "paragraph8": "When applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality, and invariance. Of these \"validity\" is most important, followed closely by \"optimality\". \"Invariance\" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought.\n",
            "ul1": "Validity. This means that the nominal coverage probability (confidence level) of the confidence interval should hold, either exactly or to a good approximation.\nOptimality. This means that the rule for constructing the confidence interval should make as much use of the information in the data-set as possible. Recall that one could throw away half of a dataset and still be able to derive a valid confidence interval. One way of assessing optimality is by the length of the interval so that a rule for constructing a confidence interval is judged better than another if it leads to intervals whose lengths are typically shorter.\nInvariance. In many applications, the quantity being estimated might not be tightly defined as such. For example, a survey might result in an estimate of the median income in a population, but it might equally be considered as providing an estimate of the logarithm of the median income, given that this is a common scale for presenting graphical results. It would be desirable that the method used for constructing a confidence interval for the median income would give equivalent results when applied to constructing a confidence interval for the logarithm of the median income: specifically the values at the ends of the latter interval would be the logarithms of the values at the ends of former interval.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Methods of derivation",
            "paragraph9": "For non-standard applications, there are several routes that might be taken to derive a rule for the construction of confidence intervals. Established rules for standard procedures might be justified or explained via several of these routes. Typically a rule for constructing confidence intervals is closely tied to a particular way of finding a point estimate of the quantity being considered.\n",

Then, denoting c as the 97.5th percentile of this distribution,\n",

            "ul1": "The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of a long-run frequency in repeated samples: \"Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the proportion of calculated 95% confidence intervals that encompassed the true value of the population parameter would tend toward 95%.\"[10]\nThe confidence interval can be expressed in terms of probability a single theoretical (yet to be realized) sample: \"There is a 95% probability that the 95% confidence interval calculated from a given future sample will cover the true value of the population parameter.\" [11] This essentially reframes the \"repeated samples\" interpretation as a probability rather than a frequency. See Neyman construction.\nThe confidence interval can be expressed in terms of statistical significance, e.g.: \"The 95% confidence interval represents values that are not statistically significantly different from the point estimate at the .05 level\".[12]\n",
            "paragraph2": "In each of the above, the following applies: If the true value of the parameter lies outside the 95% confidence interval, then a sampling event has occurred (namely, obtaining a point estimate of the parameter at least this far from the true parameter value) which had a probability of .05 (or less) of happening by chance.\n",
            "paragraph3": "To the frequentist, probability is a proportion describing the emergent pattern over many observable samples and is not applicable to a single event.  All of the interpretations above describe the long-run behavior of the confidence interval procedure over many samples.  Understanding of this long-run performance provides the experimenter confidence in whether a single observed interval indeed covers the true population parameter.  One can therefore make the statement, \"I am 95% confident the unknown fixed true population parameter is within the computed confidence interval.\"  The key is to not apply a probability statement to a single event.  A calculated confidence interval either covers the unknown fixed true population parameter or it does not.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Misunderstandings",
            "paragraph4": "Confidence intervals and levels are frequently misunderstood, and published studies have shown that even professional scientists often misinterpret them.\n",
            "ul2": "A 95% confidence level does not mean that for a given realized interval there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval (i.e., a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter).[19] According to the strict frequentist interpretation, once an interval is calculated, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not; it is no longer a matter of probability. The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval.[20] Neyman himself (the original proponent of confidence intervals) made this point in his original paper:[11]\"It will be noticed that in the above description, the probability statements refer to the problems of estimation with which the statistician will be concerned in the future. In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to α. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given [particular limits]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value [falling between these limits] is equal to α? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made...\"\n",
            "ul3": "A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval.\nA confidence interval is not a definitive range of plausible values for the sample parameter, though it is often heuristically taken as a range of plausible values.\nA particular confidence level of 95% calculated from an experiment does not mean that there is a 95% probability of a sample parameter from a repeat of the experiment falling within this interval.[17]\n"

Some authors in medical journals promoted confidence intervals as early as the 1970s. Despite this, confidence intervals were rarely used until the following decade, when they quickly became standard. By the late 1980s, medical journals began to require the reporting of confidence intervals.\n"

            "paragraph2": "Welch presented an example which clearly shows the difference between the theory of confidence intervals and other theories of interval estimation (including Fisher's fiducial intervals and objective Bayesian intervals). Robinson called this example \"ossibly the best known counterexample for Neyman's version of confidence interval theory.\" To Welch, it showed the superiority of confidence interval theory; to critics of the theory, it shows a deficiency. Here we present a simplified version.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Suppose that \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2))\n\n are independent observations from a Uniform(θ − 1/2, θ + 1/2) distribution. Then the optimal 50% confidence procedure is\n",

Welch showed that the first confidence procedure dominates the second, according to desiderata from confidence interval theory; for every \n\n\n\n\nθ\n\n1\n\n\n≠\nθ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{1}\\neq \\theta }\n\n, the probability that the first procedure contains \n\n\n\n\nθ\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{1))\n\n is less than or equal to the probability that the second procedure contains \n\n\n\n\nθ\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{1))\n\n. The average width of the intervals from the first procedure is less than that of the second. Hence, the first procedure is preferred under classical confidence interval theory.\n",

The second procedure does not have this property.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Moreover, when the first procedure generates a very short interval, this indicates that \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2))\n\n are very close together and hence only offer the information in a single data point. Yet the first interval will exclude almost all reasonable values of the parameter due to its short width. The second procedure does not have this property.\n",
            "paragraph8": "The two counter-intuitive properties of the first procedure—100% coverage when \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2))\n\n are far apart and almost 0% coverage when \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2))\n\n are close together—balance out to yield 50% coverage on average. However, despite the first procedure being optimal, its intervals offer neither an assessment of the precision of the estimate nor an assessment of the uncertainty one should have that the interval contains the true value.\n",
            "paragraph9": "This counter-example is used to argue against naïve interpretations of confidence intervals. If a confidence procedure is asserted to have properties beyond that of the nominal coverage (such as relation to precision, or a relationship with Bayesian inference), those properties must be proved; they do not follow from the fact that a procedure is a confidence procedure.\n",

Morey et al. point out that several of these confidence procedures, including the one for ω2, have the property that as the F statistic becomes increasingly small—indicating misfit with all possible values of ω2—the confidence interval shrinks and can even contain only the single value ω2 = 0; that is, the CI is infinitesimally narrow (this occurs when \n\n\n\np\n≥\n1\n−\nα\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\geq 1-\\alpha /2}\n\n for a \n\n\n\n100\n(\n1\n−\nα\n)\n%\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 100(1-\\alpha )\\%}\n\n CI).\n",
            "paragraph11": "This behavior is consistent with the relationship between the confidence procedure and significance testing: as F becomes so small that the group means are much closer together than we would expect by chance, a significance test might indicate rejection for most or all values of ω2. Hence the interval will be very narrow or even empty (or, by a convention suggested by Steiger, containing only 0). However, this does not indicate that the estimate of ω2 is very precise. In a sense, it indicates the opposite: that the trustworthiness of the results themselves may be in doubt. This is contrary to the common interpretation of confidence intervals that they reveal the precision of the estimate.\n"
