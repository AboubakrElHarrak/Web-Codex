Usually, the data size of multimedia is large such as video; therefore, multimedia data often require a large storage.\nMultimedia database consume a lot of processing time, as well as bandwidth.\nSome multimedia data types such as video, audio, and animation sequences have temporal requirements that have implications on their storage, manipulation and presentation, but images, video and graphics data have special constraints in terms of their content.\n"
