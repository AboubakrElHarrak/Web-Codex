            "paragraph2": "In the late 19th century the first diagrams appeared that pictured business activities, actions, processes, or operations, and in the first half of the 20th century the first structured methods for documenting business process activities emerged. One of those methods was the flow process chart, introduced by Frank Gilbreth to members of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1921 with the presentation, entitled “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”. Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into industrial engineering curricula.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The emergence of the field of systems engineering can be traced back to Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1940s. The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts' properties, motivated various industries to apply the discipline. One of the first to define the function model in this field was the British engineer William Gosling. In his book The design of engineering systems (1962, p. 25) he stated:  \n",
            "paragraph4": "One of the first well defined function models, was the functional flow block diagram (FFBD) developed by the defense-related TRW Incorporated in the 1950s. In the 1960s it was exploited by the NASA to visualize the time sequence of events in a space systems and flight missions. It is further widely used in classical systems engineering to show the order of execution of system functions.\n"

            "paragraph1": "In systems engineering and software engineering a function model is created with a functional modeling perspective. The functional perspective is one of the perspectives possible in business process modelling, other perspectives are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.\n",
            "paragraph2": "A functional modeling perspective concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:\n",
            "ul1": "Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.\nStore:\t   Data-collection or some sort of material.\nFlow:\t   Movement of data or material in the process.\nExternal Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.\n",

            "paragraph6": "Functional decomposition refers broadly to the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed from those parts by function composition. In general, this process of decomposition is undertaken either for the purpose of gaining insight into the identity of the constituent components, or for the purpose of obtaining a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of modularity.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Functional decomposition has a prominent role in computer programming, where a major goal is to modularize processes to the greatest extent possible. For example, a library management system may be broken up into an inventory module, a patron information module, and a fee assessment module. In the early decades of computer programming, this was manifested as the \"art of subroutining,\" as it was called by some prominent practitioners.\n",
            "paragraph8": "Functional decomposition of engineering systems is a method for analyzing engineered systems. The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of the block diagram can be described without an \"and\" or \"or\" in the description.\n",
            "paragraph9": "This exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure function. When a system is composed of pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function.\n"

The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems.
