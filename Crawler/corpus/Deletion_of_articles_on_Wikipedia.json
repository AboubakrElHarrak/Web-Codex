            },
            "paragraph1": "Volunteer editors of Wikipedia delete articles in the online encyclopedia on a regular basis, following processes that have been formulated by the site's community over time. The most common route is outright deletion of articles that are clearly in violation of rules of the website (speedy deletion). Other mechanisms include an intermediate collaborative process that bypasses a full discussion (proposed deletion or PROD), and full discussion at the dedicated forum called Articles for deletion (AfD). As a technical action, deletion can only be carried out by a subset of editors who have been assigned particular technical privileges by the community, called administrators. A deletion that has been carried out can be contested by appeal to the deleting administrator, or on another discussion board called Deletion review (DRV).\n",
            "paragraph2": "Unless an administrator deletes an article on sight, the deletion process involves the addition of a template to the article by an editor, indicating to readers and other editors which kind of deletion process is sought for that article. The removal of a template proposing speedy deletion or proposed deletion often precipitates a formal nomination for deletion through AfD, whereas the removal of an AfD template is not permitted until the discussion has concluded. When an article is deleted, the article's talk page is generally also deleted, as are links that redirect to the deleted article. Deletion discussions are carried out on separate pages dedicated to that purpose and are not deleted. Wikipedia administrators have the ability to see content that has been deleted, but other editors and visitors to the site do not.[note 1] Processes exist for editors to request access to deleted content to use for other purposes.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Occasionally, instances of deletion attract public attention, causing controversy, or criticism of Wikipedia or other entities. Conventions and practices of deletion have caused a long-lasting controversy within the Wikipedia community itself, with two schools of thought forming, one generally favoring deletion as a conventional and quite routine practice (deletionism), and the other proposing broader retention (inclusionism).\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Purpose",
            "paragraph1": "In accordance with community conventions, deletion is used to ensure that the subject of each Wikipedia article is worthy of encyclopedic coverage, i.e. that it is notable.: 218  Deletion is also used to remove from the encyclopedia content that violates intellectual property rights, particularly copyright, and content that is purely intended to advertise a product.: 218 \n",
            "subtitle1": "Deletionism and inclusionism"
        },
        {
            "title": "Overview of processes",
            "subtitle1": "Speedy deletion",
            "paragraph1": "Certain articles on Wikipedia may be deleted by administrators without community input. However, \"according to Wikipedia policy, editors should only nominate an article for speedy deletion under limited circumstances, such as pure vandalism, and not mark legitimate pages without good faith discussion\".\n",
            "paragraph2": "Wikipedia \"maintains an extensive list\" of criteria for speedy deletion,: 220  and the majority of deleted pages fall under one of these criteria for speedy deletion (spam, vandalism, test pages and so on) and are deleted by any administrator as soon as they see them,: 201  either because they have been tagged for deletion by an editor who reviewed a newly created page, or because the administrator has directly reviewed such a page. Speedy deletion is also widely used to address copyright violations, and in some cases has been applied to the mass-deletion of articles created by identified sock puppet accounts of editors who were paid to create articles in violation of Wikipedia's terms of use.\n",
            "paragraph3": "A non-administrator seeking the speedy deletion of an article typically adds a speedy deletion template to the top of the article, which in turn adds the article to a list checked by administrators for this purpose.: 220 \n",
            "subtitle2": "Proposed deletion",
            "paragraph4": "Proposed deletion, or PROD, is an intermediate process that was developed for articles that do not meet the criteria for speedy deletion, but for which a full discussion is likely unnecessary. As with speedy deletion, a template is added to the page indicating that deletion is sought, and if no editor contests or removes the tag within a seven-day period, the article will then be deleted.: 221 \n",
            "paragraph5": "Due to concerns regarding defamation and other personality rights, Wikipedia policies direct special attention to biographies of living persons, which may be deleted for lacking citations. Schneider et al. identify proposed deletions of such biographies (BLP-PROD) as a separate path to deletion.: 2, 8 \n",
            "subtitle3": "Articles for deletion",
            "image1": {

            },
            "paragraph6": "For articles that do not meet the criteria for speedy deletion, and for which proposed deletion is not attempted, or a PROD tag is removed, editors can nominate the article for deletion through community discussion. Discussions typically last seven days, after which a deciding editor determines whether a consensus has been reached. Deletion discussions are carried out on separate pages in Wikipedia's project space dedicated to that purpose, and are not deleted. Any editor may participate in the discussion, and certain Wikipedia editors are particularly frequent participants in AfD discussions. Discussions can be cut short under a Wikipedia policy called the \"Snowball Clause\" (or \"WP:SNOW\"),: 158  where an overwhelming consensus for a particular outcome quickly develops, and conversely can be extended several times, on rare occasions lasting a month or more. Wikipedia policy encourages editors to use deletion as a \"last resort\" following attempts to improve an article, for instance by conducting additional research.\nSeparate discussion boards exist for the deletion of other kinds of content, including \"Categories for discussion\" (CfD), \"Images for discussion\" (IfD), \"Templates for discussion\" (TfD), and \"Miscellany for deletion\" (MfD). The last one encompasses proposals to delete project-space pages, portals, and user-space pages.: 224 \n",
            "paragraph7": "Discussions are initiated with a proposal to delete, but they may resolve in a number of different possible outcomes. Other common possibilities are that the article is kept, whether by consensus to keep, or the absence of consensus for another outcome; that it is merged into another article; or that the title is redirected to another article, the latter of which may or may not entail deletion of the edit history of the deleted page. Wikipedia policy supports finding \"alternatives to deletion\" (ATD), which may include any of these alternatives. Another possibility is that the article may be moved to draft space for further development. However, pages in draft space that are not edited for a period of six months are deleted as abandoned. Moving an article to draft space may therefore be considered a soft form of deletion, if it is unlikely that further edits will be made to the article once it has been moved.\n",
            "subtitle4": "Deletion review and undeletion",
            "paragraph8": "The outcomes of deletion discussions can be appealed to another discussion board called Deletion review, which may result in \"undeletion\" of previously deleted content.: 226 \n",
            "paragraph9": "In some instances, an article is repeatedly recreated after being deleted, to the point where an administrator locks the page so that an article can no longer be created at that title, which is referred to as \"salting\", in reference to the ancient tradition of salting the earth.: 226 : 217 \n",
            "subtitle5": "Out-of-process deletions",
            "paragraph10": "Rarely, a Wikipedia article might be deleted for reasons unrelated to administrator action or community discussion.  In theory, the legitimate case of this is when the Wikimedia Foundation deletes an article, perhaps due to a legal concern such as a court order external to Wikipedia, but this is extremely rare.  A highly unusual case of attempted censorship of Wikipedia was the Pierre-sur-Haute military radio station article.  French military officials coerced a French Wikipedia administrator to delete the article.  This proved ineffective as the article was restored a short time later by a Swiss administrator. Finally, a Wikipedia vandal can soft-delete a page by making an edit that blanks the page,: 204  although this will almost always be quickly detected and undone by other editors. For example, the content of Donald Trump's Wikipedia article was briefly deleted in 2015 before being promptly restored. In rare cases, however, an administrator may blank the page of a contentious discussion, while preserving the edit history of the page.: 224 \n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Deletions attracting public attention",
            "paragraph1": "As an early notable example, the 2007 deletion of Mzoli's was given substantial coverage in the media due to a dispute over an editor deleting what was almost the initial version only 22 minutes after being created by Jimmy Wales, one of Wikipedia's founders.\n",
            "paragraph2": " In November 2021, the English Wikipedia's entry for \"Mass killings under communist regimes\" was nominated for deletion, with some editors arguing that it has \"a biased 'anti-Communist' point of view\", that \"it should not resort to 'simplistic presuppositions that events are driven by any specific ideology'\", and that \"by combining different elements of research to create a 'synthesis', this constitutes original research and therefore breaches Wikipedia rules.\" This was criticized by historian Robert Tombs, who called it \"morally indefensible, at least as bad as Holocaust denial, because 'linking ideology and killing' is the very core of why these things are important. I have read the Wikipedia page, and it seems to me careful and balanced. Therefore attempts to remove it can only be ideologically motivated – to whitewash Communism.\" Other Wikipedia editors and users on social media opposed the deletion of the article. On December 1, 2021, a panel of four administrators found that the discussion yielded no consensus, meaning that the status quo was retained, and the article was not deleted.\n"
