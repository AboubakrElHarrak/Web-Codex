This comes at the cost of reduced replaceability of components. By definition, SoC designs are fully or nearly fully integrated across different component modules. For these reasons, there has been a general trend towards tighter integration of components in the computer hardware industry, in part due to the influence of SoCs and lessons learned from the mobile and embedded computing markets.

Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a memory hierarchy and cache hierarchy.  In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many low-power embedded microcontrollers, this is not necessary.  Memory technologies for SoCs include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM) and flash memory.  As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive static RAM (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper dynamic RAM (DRAM).  When an SoC has a cache hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement processor registers and cores' L1 caches whereas DRAM will be used for lower levels of the cache hierarchy including main memory.  \"Main memory\" may be specific to a single processor (which can be multi-core) when the SoC has multiple processors, in which case it is distributed memory and must be sent via § Intermodule communication on-chip to be accessed by a different processor.

In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard combinatorial optimization problem, and can indeed be NP-hard fairly easily. Therefore, sophisticated optimization algorithms are often required and it may be practical to use approximation algorithms or heuristics in some cases. Additionally, most SoC designs contain multiple variables to optimize simultaneously, so Pareto efficient solutions are sought after in SoC design. Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of SoCs and introducing trade-offs in system design.\n",

Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the total cost of ownership of the SoC. Finally, waste heat from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy. The amount of energy used in a circuit is the integral of power consumed with respect to time, and the average rate of power consumption is the product of current by voltage.

            "paragraph2": "When all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched. These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.\n",
            "paragraph3": "SoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:\n",
            "ul1": "Full custom ASIC\nStandard cell ASIC\nField-programmable gate array (FPGA)\n",
            "paragraph4": "ASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.\n",
            "paragraph5": "SoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.\n",
            "paragraph6": "However, like most very-large-scale integration (VLSI) designs, the total cost[clarification needed] is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of lower yields[clarification needed] and higher non-recurring engineering costs.\n",
            "paragraph7": "When it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a system in package (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single package. When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler. Another reason SiP may be preferred is waste heat may be too high in a SoC for a given purpose because functional components are too close together, and in an SiP heat will dissipate better from different functional modules since they are physically further apart.\n"
