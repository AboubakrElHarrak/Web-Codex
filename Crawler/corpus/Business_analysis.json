Solutions often include a software-systems development component, but may also consist of process improvements, organizational change or strategic planning and policy development. The person who carries out this task is called a business analyst or BA.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Business analysts do not work solely on developing software systems. But work across the organisation, solving business problems in consultation with business stakeholders. Whilst most of the work that business analysts do today relate to software development/solutions, this derives from the ongoing massive changes businesses all over the world are experiencing in their attempts to digitise.\n",

This may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems.\nTo evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system.

            "paragraph4": "In line with this, the core business analyst role could be defined as an internal consultancy role that has the responsibility for investigating business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, defining requirements and ensuring the effective use of information systems in meeting the needs of the business.\n"

At the highest level of the models are end-to-end business processes that would be common to many businesses. Below that business process level would be a level of activities, sub-activities and finally tasks. The task level is the most granular and when modeled depicts a particular workflow. As business processes get documented on the workflow level, they become more heavily influenced or \"enabled\" by characteristics that impact that particular businesses. These \"workflow enablers\" are considered to be Workflow Design, Information Systems/IT, Motivation and Measurement, Human Resources & Organization, Policies and Rules, and Facilities/Physical Environment. This technique of process leveling and analysis assists business analysts in understanding what is really required for a particular business and where there are possibilities to re-engineer a process for greater efficiency in the future state.\n"

            "paragraph2": "One way to assess these goals is to measure the return on investment (ROI) for all projects. According to Forrester Research, more than $100 billion is spent annually in the U.S. on custom and internally developed software projects.  For all of these software development projects, keeping accurate data is important and business leaders are constantly asking for the return or ROI on a proposed project or at the conclusion of an active project. However, asking for the ROI without sufficient data of where value is created or destroyed may result in inaccurate projections.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Reduce waste and complete projects on time",
            "paragraph3": "Project delays are costly in several ways:\n",
            "ul2": "Project costs – For every month of delay, the project team costs and expenses continue to accumulate. When a large part of the development team has been outsourced, the costs will start to add up quickly and are very visible if contracted on a time and materials basis (T&M). Fixed price contracts with external parties limit this risk.[11]  For internal resources, the costs of delays are not as readily apparent, unless time spent by resources is being tracked against the project, as labor costs are essentially ‘fixed’ costs.\nOpportunity costs – Opportunity costs come in two types – lost revenue and unrealized expense reductions. Some projects are specifically undertaken with the purpose of driving new or additional revenues to the bottom line.  For every month of delay, a company foregoes a month of this new revenue stream.  The purpose of other projects is to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.  Again, each month of failure postpones the realization of these expense reductions by another month.  In the vast majority of cases, these opportunities are never captured or analyzed, resulting in misleading ROI calculations.  Of the two opportunity costs, the lost revenue is the most egregious – and the effects are greater and longer lasting.\n",
            "paragraph4": "On a lot of projects (particularly larger ones) the project manager is the one responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time. The BA's job is more to ensure that if a project is not completed on time then at least the highest priority requirements are met.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Document the right requirements",
            "paragraph5": "Business analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs. Essentially, they want to define the right application.  This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to ‘customer’ feedback,  and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program.  If a business analyst has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written – resulting in rework as discussed below.  The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the development cycle.  Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused.  Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or \"Keep it Simple\" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going maintenance of the implemented solution.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Improve project efficiency",
            "paragraph6": "Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and by shortening project length.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Rework is a common industry headache and it has become so common at many organizations that it is often built into project budgets and time lines. It generally refers to extra work needed in a project to fix errors due to incomplete or missing requirements and can impact the entire software development process from definition to coding and testing. The need for rework can be reduced by ensuring that the requirements gathering and definition processes are thorough and by ensuring that the business and technical members of a project are involved in these processes from an early stage.\n",
            "paragraph8": "Shortening project length presents two potential benefits. For every month that a project can be shortened, project resource costs can be diverted to other projects. This can lead to savings on the current project and lead to earlier start times of future projects (thus increasing revenue potential).\n"
