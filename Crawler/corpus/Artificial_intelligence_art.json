            "paragraph3": "Since their design in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are often used by AI artists. This system uses a \"Generator\" to create new images and a \"Discriminator\" to decide which created images are considered successful.\n",
            "paragraph4": "DeepDream, released by Google in 2015, is one of the more well-known AI art tools. DeepDream uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like psychedelic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.\n",

The artwork was created by \"Obvious\", a Paris-based collective.\n"
