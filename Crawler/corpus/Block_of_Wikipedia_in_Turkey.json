On 29 April 2017, Turkish authorities blocked online access to all its language editions throughout the country. The restrictions were imposed by Turkish Law No. 5651, due to the English version's article on state-sponsored terrorism (in the version of 29 April 2017), where Turkey was described as a sponsor country for ISIL and Al-Qaeda, which Turkish courts viewed as a public manipulation of mass media. Requests by the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority to edit several articles to comply with Turkish law were not acted on.\n",

It also had an accompanying hashtag of the same name.\n",

In October 2014, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had \"poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Al-Assad\".\n",

            "paragraph3": "On 25 April, Turkey conducted several airstrikes on YPG, YPJ, and PKK facilities in both Syria and Iraq (Sinjar). 40 militants, including five Peshmerga soldiers, were killed at Iraq's Sinjar Mountains, and more than 20 YPG and YPJ fighters were killed on Syria's Mount Karakoc. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) threatened to withdraw from the operation to capture Raqqa if the United States did not take measures to stop Turkey's airstrikes against the group. In response, the US began to patrol the border alongside SDF troops in order to force a ceasefire between its two allies.\n",
            "paragraph4": "On 26 April, continuing the purges that started in 2016, 1,009 police officers were detained based on accusations of being secretly involved with the Gülenist network within the Turkish police force. 9,100 officers have been suspended. On 29 April, 3,974 more civil servants were dismissed. Media outlets and reporters were heavily targeted; 190 news organizations were banned and at least 120 journalists were imprisoned. Together with the ban of Wikipedia and television dating game shows, The New York Times described the moves as \"an expand crackdown on dissent and free expression\".\n"

            "paragraph1": "Law No. 5651, known as the Internet Act (IA), was enacted on 4 May 2007. The purpose of this law was described by the now-defunct Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication as follows: \"There are two reasons for the law to be brought. The first reason: to determine the liability and the responsibility of collective use providers, access providers, location providers, and content providers, which are the main actors of the Internet. The other reason is to determine the procedures and fundamentals related to the specific crimes committed over the Internet and fighting these through content, location and access providers.\" More recently, the law has been used to censor individuals, journalists and the media. As of June 2017, at least 127,000 websites are estimated to have been blocked in Turkey, along with another 95,000 individual web pages. According to the 2018 Web Report of the Freedom of Expression Association (İfade Özgürlüğü Derneği) access to 245,826 websites was blocked in Turkey by the end of 2018, with access to a total of 54,904 websites and domain names blocked in 2018 alone.\n"

Reuters and the BBC reported that the Turkish authorities had blocked all access to Wikipedia in the country beginning at 5:00 AM GMT. Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority simply stated: \"After technical analysis and legal consideration based on the Law Nr.  5651 [governing the internet], an administrative measure has been taken for this website.\" \nUsers reported that they could only access Wikipedia using tools such as private VPNs.\n",

Referring to an email statement made by the Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications Ministry, Turkish News source Anadolu Agency reported that the block was due to its articles and comments describing Turkey's alleged involvement with terror groups. The ministry said, \"Instead of coordinating against terrorism, it has become part of an information source which is running a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena.\"\n",
            "paragraph2": "After court objection by Bilgi University professor Yaman Akdeniz, the Ankara 2nd Civil Court of Peace said that the causes of the block were the following articles on the English Wikipedia:\n",

            "paragraph4": "According to a BBC report, the Hürriyet daily newspaper said that Ankara had asked Wikipedia to remove the offending content, adding that the access ban would be lifted if Wikipedia met Turkey's demands. Later in the day, the provisional \"administrative measure\" was replaced by a court order, issued by the Ankara 1st Criminal Court of Peace, blocking Wikipedia as a \"protective measure\".\n",
            "paragraph5": "According to a report by the Anadolu Agency, the country \"has a history of demanding that international websites take such steps as having a representative office in the country, complying with principles of international law, implementing court rulings, and not being part of any smear campaign or operation in Turkey\".\n",
            "paragraph6": "On 3 May 2017, the Wikimedia Foundation submitted an objection to the block to Ankara's 1st Penal Court of Peace, but it was rejected by the court on 5 May. The ruling stated that the country-wide block would continue as the \"offending\" pages had not been removed. The head of Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority, Omer Fatih Sayan, explained: \"It is not possible to open access to Wikipedia so long as the decisions are not implemented.\" The same day, the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) published the following official statement:\n"

In a tweet made on the first day of the block, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for those criticizing the decision as censorship, saying \"Access to information is a fundamental human right. Turkish people I will always stand with you to fight for this right.\" The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, stated that it was committed to keeping the site available in Turkey and pushing for a \"judicial review\" of the decision.\n",

Minister of transport, maritime and communication Ahmet Arslan denied that Wikipedia was blocked completely and stated that the Wikipedia block was just partial due to Article 22 of the Constitution of Turkey and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n",

All the appeals were rejected by the Ankara 2nd Criminal Judgeship of Peace. Therefore the initial blocking decision become final. Therefore the Wikimedia Foundation as well as the academics Yaman Akdeniz and Kerem Altıparmak lodged separate individual applications with the Constitutional Court of Turkey. Unlike in previous applications involving the Twitter and YouTube platforms, the Constitutional Court did not issue a swift judgment and for almost 2.5 years there was no development whatsoever involving the individual applications lodged with the Constitutional Court.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Because of the delays, in May 2019, the Wikimedia Foundation filed an application with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), stating that the ban was \"a violation of the right to freedom of expression\". The Foundation was represented by English barrister Can Yeğinsu  and Turkish attorney Gönenç Gürkaynak. In July 2019, the Wikimedia Foundation published a post on their social media accounts, announcing that the ECHR had expedited the case. Later in August, the ECHR announced that it had given Turkey until the end of October to justify the ban. The Constitutional Court of Turkey (AYM) weighed in on the issue on 11 September 2019 to decide whether the ban was in violation of the freedom of expression or not. A pro-government journalist later stated that the court had considered rescinding the ban. At the end of October, the ECHR gave Turkey an additional six weeks to work on any potential justification that they might have for this ban. On 25 November 2019, Dunja Mijatović, the Commissioner for Human Rights, declared the blocking \"unacceptable in a democratic society and not compatible with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protects freedom of expression\". The General Assembly of the Constitutional Court of Turkey announced that the case would be reviewed on 26 December 2019 during their meeting. On 26 December 2019, the court ruled in a 10–6 vote that the block of Wikipedia violated the freedom of expression and ordered it to be lifted immediately.\n",

By the time of the Constitutional Court's decision in January 2020, it had reached 338,882 articles. This shows that during the block of 2.5 years, approximately 49,000 articles were created in Wikipedia either through different circumvention methods or by Turkish speakers who live elsewhere.\n"
