            "paragraph1": "In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. \nEach uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.\n",
            "paragraph3": "For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management). \n",
            "paragraph4": "What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).\n",
            "paragraph5": "Applied ontology is considered a spiritual successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes. Artificial intelligence has retained the most attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation, but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to AI.\n"

            "title": "Etymology",
            "paragraph1": "The compound word ontology combines onto-, from the Greek ὄν, on (gen. ὄντος, ontos), i.e. \"being; that which is\", which is the present participle of the verb εἰμί, eimí, i.e. \"to be, I am\", and -λογία, -logia, i.e. \"logical discourse\", see classical compounds for this type of word formation.\n",
            "paragraph2": "While the etymology is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the New Latin form ontologia, appeared in 1606 in the work Ogdoas Scholastica by Jacob Lorhard (Lorhardus) and in 1613 in the Lexicon philosophicum by Rudolf Göckel (Goclenius).\n",
            "paragraph3": "The first occurrence in English of ontology as recorded by the OED (Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, 2008) came in Archeologia Philosophica Nova or New Principles of Philosophy by Gideon Harvey.\n"

            "title": "History",
            "paragraph1": "Ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, which deals with questions like \"what exists?\" and \"what is the nature of reality?\". One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics, is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals, intrinsic and extrinsic properties, or essence and existence. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems[citation needed]. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning, which was only marginally successful. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge-based systems. In particular, David Powers introduced the word ontology to AI to refer to real world or robotic grounding, publishing in 1990 literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a AAAI Summer Symposium Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology, with an expanded version published in SIGART Bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings.  Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.\n",
            "paragraph3": "\nIn 1993, the widely cited web page and paper \"Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing\" by Tom Gruber used ontology as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies. Gruber introduced the term as a specification of a conceptualization: ",
            "paragraph4": "\nAttempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance, Gruber stated (1993): ",
            "paragraph5": "As refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: \"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity.\"\n"

            "title": "Components",
            "paragraph1": "Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed.  Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes and relations.  In this section each of these components is discussed in turn.\n",

            "paragraph3": "Ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages.\n"

            "subtitle1": "Domain ontology",
            "paragraph1": "A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world, such as biology or politics. Each domain ontology typically models domain-specific definitions of terms. For example, the word card has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the \"playing card\" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the \"punched card\" and \"video card\" meanings.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Since domain ontologies are written by different people, they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways, and are often incompatible within the same project. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand-tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand-tuning. This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.)[citation needed].\n",
            "paragraph3": "At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies, but this area of research is still ongoing, and it's a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Upper ontology",
            "paragraph4": "An upper ontology (or foundation ontology) is a model of the commonly shared relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It usually employs a core glossary that overarches the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Standardized upper ontologies available for use include BFO, BORO method, Dublin Core, GFO, Cyc, SUMO, UMBEL, the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), and DOLCE. WordNet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.\n",

The most established ontology visualization methods, namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al. A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL).\n"

            "title": "Engineering",
            "paragraph1": "Ontology engineering (also called ontology building)  is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain. It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tools and languages that support them.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications, and organizational procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles, such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Known challenges with ontology engineering include:\n",
            "ol1": "1 - Ensuring the ontology is current with domain knowledge and term use\n2 - Providing sufficient specificity and concept coverage for the domain of interest, thus minimizing the content completeness problem\n3 - Ensuring the ontology can support its use cases\n",

            "paragraph3": "Ontology editors are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of ontologies. It is common for ontology editors to use one or more ontology languages.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Aspects of ontology editors include: visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model, inference engines and information extraction; support for modules; the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching; and the support of meta-ontologies such as OWL-S, Dublin Core, etc.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Learning",
            "paragraph5": "Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.  Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents, for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Research",
            "paragraph6": "Epistemological assumptions, which in research asks \"What do you know? or \"How do you know it?\", creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research. As epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths, individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building. Simply, epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have.\n"
