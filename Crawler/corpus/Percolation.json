            "paragraph1": "In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation (from Latin percolare, \"to filter\" or \"trickle through\") refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. \nIt is described by Darcy's law.\nBroader applications have since been developed that cover connectivity of many systems modeled as lattices or graphs, analogous to connectivity of lattice components in the filtration problem that modulates capacity for percolation.\n"

            "paragraph1": "During the last decades, percolation theory, the mathematical study of percolation, has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics, materials science, complex networks, epidemiology, and other fields. For example, in geology, percolation refers to filtration of water through soil and permeable rocks. The water flows to recharge the groundwater in the water table and aquifers. In places where infiltration basins or septic drain fields are planned to dispose of substantial amounts of water, a percolation test is needed beforehand to determine whether the intended structure is  likely to succeed or fail.\nIn two dimensional square lattice  percolation is defined as follows. A site is \"occupied\" with\nprobability p or \"empty\" (in which case its edges are removed) with probability 1 – p; the\ncorresponding problem is called site percolation, see Fig. 2. \n",
            "paragraph2": "Percolation typically exhibits universality. Statistical physics concepts such as scaling theory, renormalization, phase transition, critical phenomena and fractals are used to characterize percolation properties.\nCombinatorics is commonly employed to study percolation thresholds.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Due to the complexity involved in obtaining exact results from analytical models of percolation, computer simulations are typically used.  The current fastest algorithm for percolation was published in 2000 by Mark Newman and Robert Ziff.\n"

Example/tepiheory: A hole (usually 6–10 inches in diameter) is dug in the ground surface (usually 12–24\" deep). Water is filled in to the hole, and the time is measured for a drop of one inch in the water surface. If the water surface quickly drops, as usually seen in poorly-graded sands, then it is a potentially good place for a septic \"leach field\". If the hydraulic conductivity of the site is low (usually in clayey and loamy soils), then the site is undesirable.\nTraffic percolation.[9][10]\nPercolation in the presence of reinforced (decentralization of the network) has been studied by Yuan et al.[11]\n"
