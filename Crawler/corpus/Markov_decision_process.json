            "paragraph1": "In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.\n",
            "paragraph2": "At each time step, the process is in some state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, and the decision maker may choose any action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n that is available in state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward \n\n\n\n\nR\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}\n\n.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The probability that the process moves into its new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function \n\n\n\n\nP\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}\n\n. Thus, the next state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n depends on the current state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and the decision maker's action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. But given \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Markov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. \"wait\") and all rewards are the same (e.g. \"zero\"), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.\n"

            "paragraph5": "The objective is to choose a policy \n\n\n\nπ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n that will maximize some cumulative function of the random rewards, typically the expected discounted sum over a potentially infinite horizon:\n",
            "paragraph6": "where \n\n\n\n \nγ\n \n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ \\gamma \\ }\n\n is the discount factor satisfying \n\n\n\n0\n≤\n \nγ\n \n≤\n \n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0\\leq \\ \\gamma \\ \\leq \\ 1}\n\n, which is usually close to 1 (for example, \n\n\n\nγ\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n(\n1\n+\nr\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma =1/(1+r)}\n\n for some discount rate r). A lower discount factor motivates the decision maker to favor taking actions early, rather than postpone them indefinitely.\n",
            "paragraph7": "A policy that maximizes the function above is called an optimal policy and is usually denoted \n\n\n\n\nπ\n\n∗\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi ^{*))\n\n. A particular MDP may have multiple distinct optimal policies. Because of the Markov property, it can be shown that the optimal policy is a function of the current state, as assumed above.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Simulator models",
            "paragraph8": "In many cases, it is difficult to represent the transition probability distributions, \n\n\n\n\nP\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}\n\n, explicitly. In such cases, a simulator can be used to model the MDP implicitly by providing samples from the transition distributions. One common form of implicit MDP model is an episodic environment simulator that can be started from an initial state and yields a subsequent state and reward every time it receives an action input. In this manner, trajectories of states, actions, and rewards, often called episodes may be produced.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Another form of simulator is a generative model, a single step simulator that can generate samples of the next state and reward given any state and action. (Note that this is a different meaning from the term generative model in the context of statistical classification.) In algorithms that are expressed using pseudocode, \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is often used to represent a generative model. For example the expression \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n,\nr\n←\nG\n(\ns\n,\na\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s',r\\gets G(s,a)}\n\n might denote the action of sampling from the generative model where \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n are the current state and action, and \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n and \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n are the new state and reward. Compared to an episodic simulator, a generative model has the advantage that it can yield data from any state, not only those encountered in a trajectory.\n",
            "paragraph10": "These model classes form a hierarchy of information content: an explicit model trivially yields a generative model through sampling from the distributions, and repeated application of a generative model yields an episodic simulator. In the opposite direction, it is only possible to learn approximate models through regression. The type of model available for a particular MDP plays a significant role in determining which solution algorithms are appropriate. For example, the dynamic programming algorithms described in the next section require an explicit model, and Monte Carlo tree search requires a generative model (or an episodic simulator that can be copied at any state), whereas most reinforcement learning algorithms require only an episodic simulator.\n"

The algorithms in this section apply to MDPs with finite state and action spaces and explicitly given transition probabilities and reward functions, but the basic concepts may be extended to handle other problem classes, for example using function approximation.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The standard family of algorithms to calculate optimal policies for finite state and action MDPs requires storage for two arrays indexed by state: value \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n, which contains real values, and policy \n\n\n\nπ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n, which contains actions.

Both recursively update a new estimation of the optimal policy and state value using an older estimation of those values.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Their order depends on the variant of the algorithm; one can also do them for all states at once or state by state, and more often to some states than others. As long as no state is permanently excluded from either of the steps, the algorithm will eventually arrive at the correct solution.\n",

In this work, a class of adaptive policies that possess uniformly maximum convergence rate properties for the total expected finite horizon reward were constructed under the assumptions of finite state-action spaces and irreducibility of the transition law.

The first detail learning automata paper is surveyed by Narendra and Thathachar (1974), which were originally described explicitly as finite state automata. Similar to reinforcement learning, a learning automata algorithm also has the advantage of solving the problem when probability or rewards are unknown. The difference between learning automata and Q-learning is that the former technique omits the memory of Q-values, but updates the action probability directly to find the learning result.

It is better for them to take an action only at the time when system is transitioning from the current state to another state.
