            "paragraph1": "Modal logic is a collection of formal systems developed to represent statements about necessity and possibility. It plays a major role in philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and natural language semantics. Modal logics extend other systems by adding unary operators \n\n\n\n◊\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Diamond }\n\n and \n\n\n\n◻\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box }\n\n, representing possibility and necessity respectively. For instance the modal formula \n\n\n\n◊\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Diamond P}\n\n can be read as \"possibly \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n\" while \n\n\n\n◻\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box P}\n\n can be read as \"necessarily \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n\". Modal logics can be used to represent different phenomena depending on what kind of necessity and possibility is under consideration. When \n\n\n\n◻\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box }\n\n is used to represent epistemic necessity, \n\n\n\n◻\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box P}\n\n states that \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is epistemically necessary, or in other words that it is known. When \n\n\n\n◻\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box }\n\n is used to represent deontic necessity, \n\n\n\n◻\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box P}\n\n states that \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is a moral or legal obligation.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In the standard relational semantics for modal logic, formulas are assigned truth values relative to a possible world. A formula's truth value at one possible world can depend on the truth values of other formulas at other accessible possible worlds. In particular, \n\n\n\n◊\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Diamond P}\n\n is true at a world if \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is true at some accessible possible world, while \n\n\n\n◻\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box P}\n\n is true at a world if \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is true at every accessible possible world. A variety of proof systems exist which are sound and complete with respect to the semantics one gets by restricting the accessibility relation. For instance, the deontic modal logic D is sound and complete if one requires the accessibility relation to be serial.\n",
            "paragraph3": "While the intuition behind modal logic date back to antiquity, the first modal axiomatic systems were developed by C. I. Lewis in 1912. The now-standard relational semantics emerged in the mid twentieth century from work by Arthur Prior, Jaakko Hintikka, and Saul Kripke. Recent developments include alternative topological semantics such as neighborhood semantics as well as applications of the relational semantics beyond its original philosophical motivation. Such applications include game theory, moral and legal theory, web design, multiverse-based set theory, and social epistemology.\n"

In this approach, the truth of a formula is determined relative to a point which is often called a possible world.

It is possible if it holds at some world that is accessible from \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n, which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is another world accessible from those worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.\n",

For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate physicalism have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies and can experience the passage of time. Saul Kripke has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers[who?] also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely \"by definition\", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Epistemic logic",
            "paragraph10": "Epistemic modalities (from the Greek episteme, knowledge), deal with the certainty of sentences.  The □ operator is translated as  \"x knows that…\", and the ◇ operator is translated as \"For all x knows, it may be true that…\"  In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help:\n",
            "paragraph11": "A person, Jones, might reasonably say both: (1) \"No, it is not possible that Bigfoot exists; I am quite certain of that\"; and, (2) \"Sure, it's possible that Bigfoots could exist\". What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the metaphysical claim that it is possible for Bigfoot to exist, even though he does not: there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, \"it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad\" is metaphysically true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not alethically true unless you match that description, and not epistemically true if it's known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed.\n",
            "paragraph12": "From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) \"It is possible that Goldbach's conjecture is true; but also possible that it is false\", and also (4) \"if it is true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false\". Here Jones means that it is epistemically possible that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there is a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not logically possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of alethic possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself.  It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach's conjecture is both true and unprovable.\n",
            "paragraph13": "Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world might have been, but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world may be (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me \"it is possible that it is raining outside\" – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that \"it is possible for it to rain outside\" – in the sense of metaphysical possibility – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.\n",
            "paragraph14": "Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if x knows that p, does x know that it knows that p? That is to say, should □P → □□P be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear, there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see the section on axiomatic systems):\n",
            "ul3": "K, Distribution Axiom: \n\n\n\n◻\n(\np\n→\nq\n)\n→\n(\n◻\np\n→\n◻\nq\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (p\\to q)\\to (\\Box p\\to \\Box q)}\n\n.\n",
            "paragraph15": "It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between \"the truth in the world\" (alethic) and \"the truth in an individual's mind\" (epistemic). An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a grammatical mood.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Temporal logic",
            "paragraph16": "Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with tense, that is, expressions with qualifications of when.  Some expressions, such as  '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes.\n",
            "paragraph17": "In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use two pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example:\n",
            "paragraph18": "There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that,\n",
            "paragraph19": "Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example,\n",
            "paragraph20": "or,\n",
            "paragraph21": "The operators F and G may seem initially foreign, but they create normal modal systems. Note that FP is the same as ¬G¬P. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, PP → □PP says (effectively), Everything that is past and true is necessary.\n",
            "paragraph22": "It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it won't; on the other hand, since we can't change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it probably isn't true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is \"fixed\", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as accidental necessity. But if the past is \"fixed\", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too.\n",
            "paragraph23": "Similarly, the problem of future contingents considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true?  Considering this thesis led Aristotle to reject the principle of bivalence for assertions concerning the future.\n",
            "paragraph24": "Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics, q.v. Linear Temporal Logic.\n",
            "paragraph25": "Versions of temporal logic can be used in computer science to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ◇P means \"at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true\"; □P means \"at all future times in the computation P will be true\". In another version, ◇P means \"at the immediate next state of the computation, P might be true\"; □P means \"at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true\". These differ in the choice of Accessibility relation. (P always means \"P is true at the current computer state\".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms.\n",
            "subtitle4": "Deontic logic",
            "paragraph26": "Likewise talk of morality, or of obligation and norms generally, seems to have a modal structure.  The difference between \"You must do this\" and \"You may do this\" looks a lot like the difference between \"This is necessary\" and \"This is possible\".  Such logics are called deontic, from the Greek for \"duty\".\n",
            "paragraph27": "Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom T semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in Kripke semantics: in symbols, \n\n\n\n◻\nϕ\n→\nϕ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box \\phi \\to \\phi }\n\n. Interpreting □ as \"it is obligatory that\", T informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then T implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false.\n",
            "paragraph28": "Instead, using Kripke semantics, we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., T holds at these worlds). These worlds are called idealized worlds. P is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, P holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.\n",
            "paragraph29": "One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is D, \n\n\n\n◻\nϕ\n→\n◊\nϕ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box \\phi \\to \\Diamond \\phi }\n\n, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that \"ought implies can\". (Clearly the \"can\" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.)\n",
            "paragraph30": "When we try to formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition K: you have stolen some money, and another, Q: you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that \"if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money\". There are two likely candidates,\n",
            "paragraph31": "But (1) and K together entail □Q, which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely isn't right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) doesn't work either: If the right representation of \"if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount\" is (2), then the right representation of (3) \"if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount\" is \n\n\n\n◻\n(\nK\n→\n(\nK\n∧\n¬\nQ\n)\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (K\\to (K\\land \\lnot Q))}\n\n. Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or \n\n\n\n◻\n¬\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box \\lnot K}\n\n. But then we can deduce \n\n\n\n◻\n(\nK\n→\n(\nK\n∧\n¬\nQ\n)\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (K\\to (K\\land \\lnot Q))}\n\n via \n\n\n\n◻\n(\n¬\nK\n)\n→\n◻\n(\nK\n→\nK\n∧\n¬\nK\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (\\lnot K)\\to \\Box (K\\to K\\land \\lnot K)}\n\n and \n\n\n\n◻\n(\nK\n∧\n¬\nK\n→\n(\nK\n∧\n¬\nQ\n)\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (K\\land \\lnot K\\to (K\\land \\lnot Q))}\n\n (the contrapositive of \n\n\n\nQ\n→\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q\\to K}\n\n); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that can't be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.\n",
            "subtitle5": "Doxastic logic",
            "paragraph32": "Doxastic logic concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the ancient Greek doxa which means \"belief\". Typically, a doxastic logic uses □, often written \"B\", to mean \"It is believed that\", or when relativized to a particular agent s, \"It is believed by s that\".\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Metaphysical questions",
            "paragraph1": "In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers \"logically possible worlds\". If a statement is true in all possible worlds, then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Under this \"possible worlds idiom,\" to maintain that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, \"There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist\". However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? Saul Kripke believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer – that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility. For him, the sentences \"you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6\" and \"there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world\" are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world. David Lewis, on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as actual is simply that it is indeed our world – this world. That position is a major tenet of \"modal realism\". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. Robert Adams holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed.  In place of \"all worlds\", you may have \"all possible next states of the computer\", or \"all possible future states of the computer\".\n"

            "paragraph1": "The basic ideas of modal logic date back to antiquity. Aristotle developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his Prior Analytics (chs 8–22), which Theophrastus attempted to improve. There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in De Interpretatione §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with potentiality and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians Diodorus Cronus, Philo the Dialectician and the Stoic Chrysippus each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom T (see below), and combined elements of modal logic and temporal logic in attempts to solve the notorious Master Argument. The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of \"temporally modal\" syllogistic. Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the Scholastics, in particular William of Ockham and John Duns Scotus, who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about essence and accident.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In the 19th century, Hugh MacColl made innovative contributions to modal logic, but did not find much acknowledgment.\nC. I. Lewis founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912 with \"Implication and the Algebra of Logic\". Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically strict implication, on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition. This work culminated in his 1932 book Symbolic Logic (with C. H. Langford), which introduced the five systems S1 through S5.\n",
            "paragraph3": "After Lewis, modal logic received little attention for several decades. Nicholas Rescher has argued that this was because Bertrand Russell rejected it. However, Jan Dejnozka has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls \"MDL\" is described in Russell's works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to \"come from confusing propositions with propositional functions,\" as he wrote in The Analysis of Matter.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Arthur Norman Prior warned Ruth Barcan Marcus to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with Willard Van Orman Quine, due to the biases against modal logic.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Ruth C. Barcan (later Ruth Barcan Marcus) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic — first and second order extensions of Lewis' S2, S4, and S5.\n",
            "paragraph6": "The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when Saul Kripke (then only a 18-year-old Harvard University undergraduate) introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as \"possible worlds\" semantics. Kripke and A. N. Prior had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or analytic tableaux, as explained by E. W. Beth.\n",
            "paragraph7": "A. N. Prior created modern temporal logic, closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators  and  meaning \"eventually\" and \"previously\". Vaughan Pratt introduced dynamic logic in 1976. In 1977, Amir Pnueli proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include propositional dynamic logic (PDL), propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL), linear temporal logic (LTL), computation tree logic (CTL), Hennessy–Milner logic, and T.[clarification needed]\n",
            "paragraph8": "The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely Boolean algebras augmented with unary operations (often called modal algebras), began to emerge with J. C. C. McKinsey's 1941 proof that S2 and S4 are decidable, and reached full flower in the work of Alfred Tarski and his student Bjarni Jónsson (Jónsson and Tarski 1951–52). This work revealed that S4 and S5 are models of interior algebra, a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the interior and closure operators of topology. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of Boolean algebras and topology. For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see Robert Goldblatt (2006).\n"
