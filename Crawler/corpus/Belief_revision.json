Whenever a revision operator satisfies the eight postulates for revision, its corresponding contraction operator satisfies the eight postulates for contraction and vice versa. If a contraction operator satisfies at least the first six postulates for contraction, translating it into a revision operator and then back into a contraction operator using the two identities above leads to the original contraction operator. The same holds starting from a revision operator.\n",

There are some examples showing that such behavior is not always reasonable: in particular, the contraction by a general condition such as \n\n\n\na\n∨\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a\\vee b}\n\n leads to the removal of more specific conditions such as \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n from the belief set; it is then unclear why the reintroduction of \n\n\n\na\n∨\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a\\vee b}\n\n should also lead to the reintroduction of the more specific condition \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. For example, if George was previously believed to have German citizenship, he was also believed to be European. Contracting this latter belief amounts to ceasing to believe that George is European; therefore, that George has German citizenship is also retracted from the belief set. If George is later discovered to have Austrian citizenship, then the fact that he is European is also reintroduced. According to the recovery postulate, however, the belief that he also has German citizenship should also be reintroduced.\n",

As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are translated into a single revision operator, which can be then translated back into exactly one contraction operator. This operator is the only one of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.\n"

Ramsey), to the hypothetical addition of \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n to the set of current beliefs followed by a check for the truth of \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n. If \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n is the set of beliefs currently held, the Ramsey test is formalized by the following correspondence:\n",

However, if the language of formulae representing beliefs itself includes the counterfactual conditional connective \n\n\n\n>\n\n\n{\\displaystyle >}\n\n, the Ramsey test leads to the Gärdenfors triviality result: there is no non-trivial revision operator that satisfies both the AGM postulates for revision and the condition of the Ramsey test. This result holds in the assumption that counterfactual formulae like \n\n\n\na\n>\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a>b}\n\n can be present in belief sets and revising formulae.

While such sets are infinite, they can always be finitely representable. However, working with deductively closed sets of formulae leads to the implicit assumption that equivalent belief sets should be considered equal when revising. This is called the principle of irrelevance of syntax.\n",

In the first case, \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n and \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n are two separate beliefs; therefore, revising by \n\n\n\n¬\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg a}\n\n should not produce any effect on \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, and the result of revision is \n\n\n\n{\n¬\na\n,\nb\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\neg a,b\\))\n\n. In the second case, \n\n\n\na\n∧\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a\\wedge b}\n\n is taken a single belief.

            "paragraph3": "The problem of using deductively closed knowledge bases is that no distinction is made between pieces of knowledge that are known by themselves and pieces of knowledge that are merely consequences of them. This distinction is instead done by the foundational approach to belief revision, which is related to foundationalism in philosophy. According to this approach, retracting a non-derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences that are not otherwise supported (by other non-derived pieces of knowledge).  This approach can be realized by using knowledge bases that are not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self-standing beliefs, that is, they are not derived beliefs. In order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the coherentist approach. This name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence\n(consistency) among all beliefs, both self-standing and derived ones. This approach is related to coherentism in philosophy.\n",

Revision can therefore be performed on the sets of possible worlds rather than on the corresponding knowledge bases.\n",

Indeed, the preference relation should depend on the previous history of revisions, rather than on the resulting knowledge base only. More generally, a preference relation gives more information about the state of mind of an agent than a simple knowledge base. Indeed, two states of mind might represent the same piece of knowledge \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n while at the same time being different in the way a new piece of knowledge would be incorporated. For example, two people might have the same idea as to where to go on holiday, but they differ on how they would change this idea if they win a million-dollar lottery. Since the basic condition of the preference ordering is that their minimal models are exactly the models of their associated knowledge base, a knowledge base can be considered implicitly represented by a preference ordering (but not vice versa).\n",

More generally, one can consider the process of merging several pieces of information (rather than just two) that might or might not have the same reliability.

The problem of merging amounts to combine a set of orderings into a single one expressing the combined  plausibility of the alternatives.

Belief revision and social choice theory are similar in that they combine a set of orderings into one. They differ on how these orderings are interpreted: preferences in social choice theory; plausibility in belief revision. Another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory, while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in belief revision.\n"

More generally, query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a belief revision, which could be update, merging, revision, iterated revision, etc. Another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking, that is, checking whether a model satisfies the result of a belief revision. A related question is whether such result can be represented in space polynomial in that of its arguments.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite, complexity studies on belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base.\n",
            "paragraph3": "A distinction is made among belief revision operators and belief revision schemes. While the former are simple mathematical operators mapping a pair of formulae into another formula, the latter depend on further information such as a preference relation. For example, the Dalal revision is an operator because, once two formulae \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n and \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n are given, no other information is needed to compute \n\n\n\nK\n∗\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K*P}\n\n. On the other hand, revision based on a preference relation is a revision scheme, because \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n and \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n do not allow determining the result of revision if the family of preference orderings between models is not given. The complexity for revision schemes is determined in the assumption that the extra information needed to compute revision is given in some compact form. For example, a preference relation can be represented by a sequence of formulae whose models are increasingly preferred. Explicitly storing the relation as a set of pairs of models is instead not a compact representation of preference because the space required is exponential in the number of propositional letters.\n",
            "paragraph4": "The complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for most belief revision operators and schemas. Most revision operators suffer from the problem of representational blow up: the result of revising two formulae is not necessarily representable in space polynomial in that of the two original formulae. In other words, revision may exponentially increase the size of the knowledge base.\n"
