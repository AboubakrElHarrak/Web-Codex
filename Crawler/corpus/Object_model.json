            "ol1": "1 - The properties of objects in general in a specific computer programming language, technology, notation or methodology that uses them. Examples are the object models of Java, the Component Object Model (COM), or Object-Modeling Technique (OMT).  Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, generic function, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages.\n2 - A collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate some specific parts of its world. In other words, the object-oriented interface to some service or system.  Such an interface is said to be the object model of the represented service or system.  For example, the Document Object Model (DOM) [1] is a collection of objects that represent a page in a web browser, used by script programs to examine and dynamically change the page.  There is a Microsoft Excel object model [2] for controlling Microsoft Excel from another program, and the ASCOM Telescope Driver [3] is an object model for controlling an astronomical telescope.\n",
