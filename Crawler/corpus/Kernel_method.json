            "paragraph1": "In machine learning, kernel machines are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support-vector machine (SVM). The general task of  pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over pairs of data points in raw representation.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.  This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates.  This approach is called the \"kernel trick\". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded. Typically, their statistical properties are analyzed using statistical learning theory (for example, using Rademacher complexity).\n"

            "paragraph1": "Kernel methods can be thought of as instance-based learners: rather than learning some fixed set of parameters corresponding to the features of their inputs, they instead \"remember\" the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th training example \n\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\ny\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {x} _{i},y_{i})}\n\n and learn for it a corresponding weight \n\n\n\n\nw\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{i))\n\n.

            "paragraph4": "Mercer's theorem is similar to a generalization of the result from linear algebra that associates an inner product to any positive-definite matrix.

            "paragraph6": "Some algorithms that depend on arbitrary relationships in the native space \n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X))}\n\n would, in fact, have a linear interpretation in a different setting: the range space of \n\n\n\nφ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi }\n\n. The linear interpretation gives us insight about the algorithm.
