Sometimes it refers to an abstract formalization of the objects and relationships found in a particular application domain: for example the customers, products, and orders found in a manufacturing organization. At other times it refers to the set of concepts used in defining such formalizations: for example concepts such as entities, attributes, relations, or tables. So the \"data model\" of a banking application may be defined using the entity-relationship \"data model\". This article uses the term in both senses.\n",

According to West and Fowler (1999) \"if this is done consistently across systems then compatibility of data can be achieved. If the same data structures are used to store and access data then different applications can share data. The results of this are indicated above. However, systems and interfaces often cost more than they should, to build, operate, and maintain. They may also constrain the business rather than support it. A major cause is that the quality of the data models implemented in systems and interfaces is poor\".\n",
            "ul1": "\"Business rules, specific to how things are done in a particular place, are often fixed in the structure of a data model. This means that small changes in the way business is conducted lead to large changes in computer systems and interfaces\".[8]\n\"Entity types are often not identified, or incorrectly identified. This can lead to replication of data, data structure, and functionality, together with the attendant costs of that duplication in development and maintenance\".[8]\n\"Data models for different systems are arbitrarily different. The result of this is that complex interfaces are required between systems that share data. These interfaces can account for between 25-70% of the cost of current systems\".[8]\n\"Data cannot be shared electronically with customers and suppliers, because the structure and meaning of data has not been standardized. For example, engineering design data and drawings for process plant are still sometimes exchanged on paper\".[8]\n",

            "paragraph5": "A data model instance may be one of three kinds according to ANSI in 1975:\n",
            "ol1": "1 - Conceptual data model:  describes the semantics of a domain, being the scope of the model. For example, it may be a model of the interest area of an organization or industry. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationship assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model. In that sense, it defines the allowed expressions in an artificial 'language' with a scope that is limited by the scope of the model.\n2 - Logical data model: describes the semantics, as represented by a particular data manipulation technology.  This consists of descriptions of tables and columns, object oriented classes, and XML tags, among other things.\n3 - Physical data model: describes the physical means by which data are stored.  This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.\n",
            "paragraph6": "The significance of this approach, according to ANSI, is that it allows the three perspectives to be relatively independent of each other. Storage technology can change without affecting either the logical or the conceptual model. The table/column structure can change without (necessarily) affecting the conceptual model.  In each case, of course, the structures must remain consistent with the other model.  The table/column structure may be different from a direct translation of the entity classes and attributes, but it must ultimately carry out the objectives of the conceptual entity class structure.  Early phases of many software development projects emphasize the design of a conceptual data model. Such a design can be detailed into a logical data model. In later stages, this model may be translated into physical data model. However, it is also possible to implement a conceptual model directly.\n"

They wanted to create \"a notation that should enable the analyst to organize the problem around any piece of hardware\". Their work was the first effort to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. The next step in IS modeling was taken by CODASYL, an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of \"a proper structure for machine-independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing\". This led to the development of a specific IS information algebra.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In the 1960s data modeling gained more significance with the initiation of the management information system (MIS) concept. According to Leondes (2002), \"during that time, the information system provided the data and information for management purposes. The first generation database system, called Integrated Data Store (IDS), was designed by Charles Bachman at General Electric. Two famous database models, the network data model and the hierarchical data model, were proposed during this period of time\". Towards the end of the 1960s, Edgar F. Codd worked out his theories of data arrangement, and proposed the relational model for database management based on first-order predicate logic.\n",
            "paragraph3": "In the 1970s entity relationship modeling emerged as a new type of conceptual data modeling, originally proposed in 1976 by Peter Chen. Entity-relationship models were being used in the first stage of information system design during the requirements analysis to describe information needs or the type of information that is to be stored in a database. This technique can describe any ontology, i.e., an overview and classification of concepts and their relationships, for a certain area of interest.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In the 1970s G.M. Nijssen developed \"Natural Language Information Analysis Method\" (NIAM) method, and developed this in the 1980s in cooperation with Terry Halpin into Object-Role Modeling (ORM). However, it was Terry Halpin's 1989 PhD thesis that created the formal foundation on which Object-Role Modeling is based.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Bill Kent, in his 1978 book Data and Reality, compared a data model to a map of a territory, emphasizing that in the real world, \"highways are not painted red, rivers don't have county lines running down the middle, and you can't see contour lines on a mountain\". In contrast to other researchers who tried to create models that were mathematically clean and elegant, Kent emphasized the essential messiness of the real world, and the task of the data modeler to create order out of chaos with out excessively distorting the truth.\n",
            "paragraph6": "In the 1980s, according to Jan L. Harrington (2000), \"the development of the object-oriented paradigm brought about a fundamental change in the way we look at data and the procedures that operate on data. Traditionally, data and procedures have been stored separately: the data and their relationship in a database, the procedures in an application program. Object orientation, however, combined an entity's procedure with its data.\"\n",

For example, different modelers usually produce different conventional data models of the same domain. This can lead to difficulty in bringing the models of different people together and is an obstacle for data exchange and data integration. Invariably, however, this difference is attributable to different levels of abstraction in the models and differences in the kinds of facts that can be instantiated (the semantic expression capabilities of the models).

That is, techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. As illustrated in the figure.

            "paragraph3": "An Information model is not a type of data model, but more or less an alternative model. Within the field of software engineering both a data model and an information model can be abstract, formal representations of entity types that include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system. Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations.\n",
            "paragraph4": "According to Lee (1999)  an information model is a representation of concepts, relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements for the domain context. More in general the term information model is used for models of individual things, such as facilities, buildings, process plants, etc. In those cases the concept is specialised to Facility Information Model, Building Information Model, Plant Information Model, etc. Such an information model is an integration of a model of the facility with the data and documents about the facility.\n",
            "paragraph5": "An information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models, irrespective of whether they are object models (e.g. using UML), entity relationship models or XML schemas.\n",

            },
            "subtitle3": "Object model",
            "paragraph6": "An object model in computer science is a collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate some specific parts of its world. In other words, the object-oriented interface to some service or system. Such an interface is said to be the object model of the represented service or system.  For example, the Document Object Model (DOM)  is a collection of objects that represent a page in a web browser, used by script programs to examine and dynamically change the page.  There is a Microsoft Excel object model for controlling Microsoft Excel from another program, and the ASCOM Telescope Driver is an object model for controlling an astronomical telescope.\n",
            "paragraph7": "In computing the term object model has a distinct second  meaning of the general properties of objects in a specific computer programming language, technology, notation or methodology that uses them. For example, the Java object model, the COM object model, or the object model of OMT.  Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages.\n",

            },
            "paragraph8": "Object-Role Modeling (ORM) is a method for conceptual modeling, and can be used as a tool for information and rules analysis.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Object-Role Modeling is a fact-oriented method for performing systems analysis at the conceptual level. The quality of a database application depends critically on its design. To help ensure correctness, clarity, adaptability and productivity, information systems are best specified first at the conceptual level, using concepts and language that people can readily understand.\n",
            "paragraph10": "The conceptual design may include data, process and behavioral perspectives, and the actual DBMS used to implement the design might be based on one of many logical data models (relational, hierarchic, network, object-oriented etc.).\n",
            "subtitle5": "Unified Modeling Language models",
            "paragraph11": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. It is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The Unified Modeling Language offers a standard way to write a system's blueprints, including:\n",
            "ul1": "Conceptual things such as business processes and system functions\nConcrete things such as programming language statements, database schemas, and\nReusable software components.\n",
            "paragraph12": "UML offers a mix of functional models, data models, and database models.\n"
