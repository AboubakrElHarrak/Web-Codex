            },
            "paragraph1": "Most criticism of Wikipedia has been directed towards its content, its community of established users, and its processes. Critics have questioned its factual reliability, the readability and organization of the articles, the lack of methodical fact-checking, and its political bias. Concerns have also been raised about systemic bias along gender, racial, political and national lines. In addition, conflicts of interest arising from corporate campaigns to influence content have also been highlighted. Further concerns include the vandalism and partisanship facilitated by anonymous editing, clique behavior from contributors as well as administrators and other top figures, social stratification between a guardian class and newer users, excessive rule-making, edit warring, and uneven application of policies.\n"

        {
            "title": "Criticism of content",
            "paragraph1": "The reliability of Wikipedia is often questioned. In \"Wikipedia: The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge\" (2010), journalist Edwin Black characterized the content of articles as a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". Oliver Kamm, in \"Wisdom?: More like Dumbness of the Crowds\" (2007), said that articles usually are dominated by the loudest and most persistent editorial voices or by an interest group with an ideological \"axe to grind\".\n",
            "paragraph2": "In his article \"The 'Undue Weight' of Truth on Wikipedia\" (2012), Timothy Messer–Kruse criticized the undue-weight policy that deals with the relative importance of sources, observing that it showed Wikipedia's goal was not to present correct and definitive information about a subject but to present the majority opinion of the sources cited. In their article \"You Just Type in What You are Looking for: Undergraduates' Use of Library Resources vs. Wikipedia\" (2012) in an academic librarianship journal, the authors noted another author's point that omissions within an article might give the reader false ideas about a topic, based upon the incomplete content of Wikipedia.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Wikipedia is sometimes characterized as having a hostile editing environment. In Common Knowledge?: An Ethnography of Wikipedia (2014), Dariusz Jemielniak, a steward for Wikimedia Foundation projects, stated that the complexity of the rules and laws governing editorial content and the behavior of the editors is a burden for new editors and a licence for the \"office politics\" of disruptive editors. In a follow-up article, Jemielniak said that abridging and rewriting the editorial rules and laws of Wikipedia for clarity of purpose and simplicity of application would resolve the bureaucratic bottleneck of too many rules. In The Rise and Decline of an Open Collaboration System: How Wikipedia's Reaction to Popularity is Causing its Decline (2013), Aaron Halfaker said the over-complicated rules and laws of Wikipedia unintentionally provoked the decline in editorial participation that began in 2009—frightening away new editors who otherwise would contribute to Wikipedia.[failed verification]\n",
            "paragraph4": "There have also been works that describe the possible misuse of Wikipedia. In \"Wikipedia or Wickedpedia?\" (2008), the Hoover Institution said Wikipedia is an unreliable resource for correct knowledge, information, and facts about a subject, because, as an open source website, the editorial content of the articles is readily subjected to manipulation and propaganda. The 2014 edition of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's official student handbook, Academic Integrity at MIT, informs students that Wikipedia is not a reliable academic source, stating, \"the bibliography published at the end of the Wikipedia entry may point you to potential sources. However, do not assume that these sources are reliable –  use the same criteria to judge them as you would any other source. Do not consider the Wikipedia bibliography as a replacement for your own research.\"\n",
            "subtitle1": "Accuracy of information",
            "paragraph5": "Wikipedia acknowledges that the encyclopedia should not be used as a primary source for research, either academic or informational. The British librarian Philip Bradley said, \"the main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers have to ensure that their data are reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.\" Likewise, Robert McHenry, editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1992 to 1997, said that readers of Wikipedia articles cannot know who wrote the article they are reading—it might have been written by an expert in the subject matter or by an amateur. In November 2015, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger told Zach Schwartz in Vice: \"I think Wikipedia never solved the problem of how to organize itself in a way that didn't lead to mob rule\" and that since he left the project, \"People that I would say are trolls sort of took over. The inmates started running the asylum.\"\n",

            },
            "paragraph6": "In \"Internet Encyclopaedias Go Head-to-head\", a 2005 article published in the scientific journal Nature, the results of a blind experiment (single-blind study), which compared the factual and informational accuracy of entries from Wikipedia and the Encyclopædia Britannica, were reported. The 42-entry sample included science articles and biographies of scientists, which were compared for accuracy by anonymous academic reviewers; they found that the average Wikipedia entry contained four errors and omissions, while the average Encyclopædia Britannica entry contained three errors and omissions. The study concluded that Wikipedia and Britannica were comparable in terms of the accuracy of its science entries. Nevertheless, the reviewers had two principal criticisms of the Wikipedia science entries: (i) thematically confused content, without an intelligible structure (order, presentation, interpretation); and (ii) that undue weight is given to controversial, fringe theories about the subject matter.\n",
            "paragraph7": "The dissatisfaction of the Encyclopædia Britannica editors led to Nature publishing additional survey documentation that substantiated the results of the comparative study. Based upon the additional documents, Encyclopædia Britannica denied the validity of the study, stating it was flawed, because the Britannica extracts were compilations that sometimes included articles written for the youth version of the encyclopedia. In turn, Nature acknowledged that some Britannica articles were compilations, but denied that such editorial details invalidated the conclusions of the comparative study of the science articles.\n",
            "paragraph8": "The editors of Britannica also said that while the Nature study showed that the rate of error between the two encyclopedias was similar, the errors in a Wikipedia article usually were errors of fact, while the errors in a Britannica article were errors of omission. According to the editors of Britannica, Britannica was more accurate than Wikipedia in that respect. Subsequently, Nature magazine rejected the Britannica response with a rebuttal of the editors' specific objections about the research method of the study.\n",

            },
            "paragraph9": "Inaccurate information that is not obviously false may persist in Wikipedia for a long time before it is challenged. The most prominent cases reported by mainstream media involved biographies of living people.\n",
            "paragraph10": "The Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident demonstrated that the subject of a biographical article must sometimes fix blatant lies about his own life. In May 2005, an anonymous user edited the biographical article on American journalist and writer John Seigenthaler so that it contained several false and defamatory statements. The inaccurate claims went unnoticed from May until September 2005 when they were discovered by Victor S. Johnson Jr., a friend of Seigenthaler. Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as Answers.com, which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of web sources. Such information can thereby develop false authority due to its presence at such sites.\n",
            "paragraph11": "In another example, on March 2, 2007, MSNBC.com reported that then-New York Senator Hillary Clinton had been incorrectly listed for 20 months in her Wikipedia biography as having been valedictorian of her class of 1969 at Wellesley College, when in fact she was not (though she did speak at commencement). The article included a link to the Wikipedia edit, where the incorrect information was added on July 9, 2005. The inaccurate information was removed within 24 hours after the MSNBC.com report appeared.\n",
            "paragraph12": "Attempts to perpetrate hoaxes may not be confined to editing existing Wikipedia articles, but can also include creating new articles. In October 2005, Alan Mcilwraith, a call center worker from Scotland, created a Wikipedia article in which he wrote that he was a highly decorated war hero.  The article was quickly identified as a hoax by other users and deleted.\n",
            "paragraph13": "There have also been instances of users deliberately inserting false information into Wikipedia in order to test the system and demonstrate its alleged unreliability. Gene Weingarten, a journalist, ran such a test in 2007, in which he inserted false information into his own Wikipedia article; it was removed 27 hours later by a Wikipedia editor. Wikipedia considers the deliberate insertion of false and misleading information to be vandalism.\n",
            "paragraph14": "Wikipedia regards the concept of a neutral point of view as one of its non-negotiable principles; however, it acknowledges that such a concept has its limitations –  its NPOV policy states that articles should be \"as far as possible\" written \"without editorial bias\". Mark Glaser, a journalist, also wrote that this may be an impossible ideal due to the inevitable biases of editors. Research has shown that articles can maintain bias in spite of the neutral point of view policy through word choice, the presentation of opinions and controversial claims as facts, and framing bias.\n",
            "paragraph15": "In August 2007, a tool called WikiScanner—developed by Virgil Griffith, a visiting researcher from the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico—was released to match edits to the encyclopedia by non-registered users with an extensive database of IP addresses. News stories appeared about IP addresses from various organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Diebold, Inc. and the Australian government being used to make edits to Wikipedia articles, sometimes of an opinionated or questionable nature. Another story stated that an IP address from the BBC itself had been used to vandalize the article on George W. Bush. The BBC quoted a Wikipedia spokesperson as praising the tool: \"We really value transparency and the scanner really takes this to another level. Wikipedia Scanner may prevent an organisation or individuals from editing articles that they're really not supposed to.\" Not everyone hailed WikiScanner as a success for Wikipedia. Oliver Kamm, in a column for The Times, argued instead that:\n",
            "paragraph16": "WikiScanner reveals conflicts of interest only when the editor does not have a Wikipedia account and their IP address is used instead. Conflict-of-interest editing done by editors with accounts is not detected, since those edits are anonymous to everyone except some Wikipedia administrators.\n",
            "paragraph17": "The 2005 Nature study also gave two brief examples of challenges that Wikipedian science writers purportedly faced on Wikipedia. The first concerned the addition of a section on violence to the schizophrenia article, which was little more than a \"rant\" about the need to lock people up, in the view of one of the article's regular editors, neuropsychologist Vaughan Bell. He said that editing it stimulated him to look up the literature on the topic.\n",
            "paragraph18": "Another dispute involved the climate researcher William Connolley, a Wikipedia editor who was opposed by others. The topic in this second dispute was \"language pertaining to the greenhouse effect\", and The New Yorker reported that this dispute, which was far more protracted, had led to arbitration, which took three months to produce a decision. The outcome of arbitration was for Connolley to be restricted to undoing edits on articles once per day.\n",
            "paragraph19": "While Wikipedia policy requires articles to have a neutral point of view, it is not immune from attempts by outsiders (or insiders) with an agenda to place a spin on articles. In January 2006, it was revealed that several staffers of members of the U.S. House of Representatives had embarked on a campaign to cleanse their respective bosses' biographies on Wikipedia, as well as inserting negative remarks on political opponents. References to a campaign promise by Martin Meehan to surrender his seat in 2000 were deleted, and negative comments were inserted into the articles on United States Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, and Eric Cantor, a congressman from Virginia. Numerous other changes were made from an IP address assigned to the House of Representatives. In an interview, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales remarked that the changes were \"not cool\".\n",
            "paragraph20": "Larry Delay and Pablo Bachelet wrote that from their perspective, some articles dealing with Latin American history and groups (such as the Sandinistas and Cuba) lack political neutrality and are written from a sympathetic Marxist perspective which treats socialist dictatorships favorably at the expense of alternative positions.\n",
            "paragraph21": "In 2008, the pro-Israel group Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) organized an e-mail campaign to encourage readers to correct perceived Israel-related biases and inconsistencies in Wikipedia. CAMERA argued the excerpts were unrepresentative and that it had explicitly campaigned merely \"toward encouraging people to learn about and edit the online encyclopedia for accuracy\". Defenders of CAMERA and the competing group, Electronic Intifada, went into mediation. Israeli diplomat David Saranga said Wikipedia is generally fair in regard to Israel. When it was pointed out that the entry on Israel mentioned the word \"occupation\" nine times, whereas the entry on the Palestinian people mentioned \"terror\" only once, he responded, \"It means only one thing: Israelis should be more active on Wikipedia. Instead of blaming it, they should go on the site much more, and try and change it.\"\n",
            "paragraph22": "Israeli political commentator Haviv Rettig Gur, reviewing widespread perceptions in Israel of systemic bias in Wikipedia articles, has argued that there are deeper structural problems creating this bias: anonymous editing favors biased results, especially if the editors organize concerted campaigns of defamation as has been done in articles dealing with Arab-Israeli issues, and current Wikipedia policies, while well-meant, have proven ineffective in handling this.\n",
            "paragraph23": "On August 31, 2008, The New York Times ran an article detailing the edits made to the biography of Alaska governor Sarah Palin in the wake of her nomination as the running mate of Arizona Senator John McCain. During the 24 hours before the McCain campaign announcement, 30 edits, many of them adding flattering details, were made to the article by the user \"Young_Trigg\". This person later acknowledged working on the McCain campaign, and having several other user accounts.\n",
            "paragraph24": "In November 2007, libelous accusations were made against two politicians from southwestern France, Jean-Pierre Grand and Hélène Mandroux-Colas, on their Wikipedia biographies. Grand asked the president of the French National Assembly and Prime Minister to reinforce the legislation on the penal responsibility of Internet sites and of authors who peddle false information in order to cause harm. Senator Jean Louis Masson then requested the Minister of Justice to tell him whether it would be possible to increase the criminal responsibilities of hosting providers, site operators, and authors of libelous content; the minister declined to do so, recalling the existing rules in the LCEN law (see Internet censorship in France).\n",
            "paragraph25": "On August 25, 2010, the Toronto Star reported that the Canadian \"government is now conducting two investigations into federal employees who have taken to Wikipedia to express their opinion on federal policies and bitter political debates.\"\n",
            "paragraph26": "In 2010, Al Jazeera's Teymoor Nabili suggested that the article Cyrus Cylinder had been edited for political purposes by \"an apparent tussle of opinions in the shadowy world of hard drives and 'independent' editors that comprise the Wikipedia industry.\" He suggested that, after the Iranian presidential election of 2009 and ensuing \"anti-Iranian activities\", a \"strenuous attempt to portray the cylinder as nothing more than the propaganda tool of an aggressive invader\" was visible. The edits following his analysis of the edits during 2009 and 2010, represented \"a complete dismissal of the suggestion that the cylinder, or Cyrus' actions, represent concern for human rights or any kind of enlightened intent,\" in stark contrast to Cyrus' own reputation as documented in the Old Testament and the people of Babylon.\n",
            "paragraph27": "Articles of particular interest to an editor or group of editors are sometimes modified based on these editors' respective points of views. Some companies and organizations—such as Sony, Diebold, Nintendo, Dell, the CIA, and the Church of Scientology—as well as individuals, such as United States Congressional staffers, were all shown to have modified the Wikipedia pages about themselves in order to present a point of view that describes them positively; these organizations may have editors who revert negative changes as soon as these changes are submitted.\n",
            "paragraph28": "The Chinese Wikipedia article on the Tiananmen Square massacre was rewritten to describe it as necessary to \"quell the counterrevolutionary riots\" and Taiwan was described as \"a province in the People’s Republic of China\". According to the BBC, \"there are indications that [such edits] are not all necessarily organic, nor random\" and were in fact orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Quality of presentation",
            "paragraph29": "In the essay, \"Can History be Open Source?: Wikipedia and the Future of the Past\" (2006), the academic historian Roy Rosenzweig criticized the encyclopedic content and writing style used in Wikipedia, for not distinguishing subjects that are important from subjects that are merely sensational; that Wikipedia is \"surprisingly accurate in reporting names, dates, and events in U.S. history\"; and that most of the factual errors he found \"were small and inconsequential\", some of which \"simply repeat widely held, but inaccurate, beliefs\", which are also repeated in the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia and in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Yet Rosenzweig's major criticism is that:\n",
            "paragraph30": "Rosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling –  encouraged by the [neutral point of view] policy –   means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history \", and quoted the historical conclusion of the biography of William Clarke Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla in the United States Civil War, as an example of weasel-word waffling:\n",
            "paragraph31": "Rosenzweig  contrasted Wikipedia's Abraham Lincoln article with that of James M. McPherson's article on Lincoln in American National Biography Online. He reports that each entry was essentially accurate in covering the major episodes of President Lincoln's life.  McPherson—a Princeton professor and winner of the Pulitzer Prize—showed \"richer contextualization\", as well as \"his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln’s voice\" and \"his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\"  By contrast Wikipedia's prose was \"both verbose and dull\" and thus difficult to read, because \"the skill and confident judgment of a seasoned historian\" are absent from the antiquarian writing style of Wikipedia, as opposed to the writing style used by professional historians in the American Heritage magazine. It was also mentioned that while Wikipedia usually provides many references, these are not the most accurate references.\n",
            "paragraph32": "In the article \"Wikipedia Cancer Information Accurate,\" a study of medical articles, Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center of Thomas Jefferson University found that the cancer entries were mostly accurate. However, Wikipedia's articles were written in college-level prose, as opposed to in the easier-to-understand ninth-grade-level prose found in the Physician Data Query (PDQ) of the National Cancer Institute. According to Lawrence, \"Wikipedia’s lack of readability may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing.\"\n",
            "paragraph33": "In its 2007 article \"Fact or Fiction? Wikipedia’s Variety of Contributors is Not Only a Strength,\" the magazine The Economist said the quality of the writing in Wikipedia articles usually indicates the quality of the editorial content: \"Inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information.\"\n",
            "paragraph34": "In the September 12, 2006, edition of The Wall Street Journal, Jimmy Wales debated with Dale Hoiberg, editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica. Hoiberg focused on a need for expertise and control in an encyclopedia and cited Lewis Mumford that overwhelming information could \"bring about a state of intellectual enervation and depletion hardly to be distinguished from massive ignorance.\" Wales emphasized Wikipedia's differences, and asserted that openness and transparency lead to quality. Hoiberg said he \"had neither the time nor space to respond to \" and \"could corral any number of links to articles alleging errors in Wikipedia\", to which Wales responded: \"No problem! Wikipedia to the rescue with a fine article\", and included a link to the Wikipedia article about criticism of Wikipedia.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Systemic bias in coverage",
            "paragraph35": "Wikipedia has been accused of systemic bias, which is to say its general nature leads, without necessarily any conscious intention, to the propagation of various prejudices. Although many articles in newspapers have concentrated on minor factual errors in Wikipedia articles, there are also concerns about large-scale, presumably unintentional effects from the increasing influence and use of Wikipedia as a research tool at all levels. In an article in the Times Higher Education magazine (London), philosopher Martin Cohen describes Wikipedia as having \"become a monopoly\" with \"all the prejudices and ignorance of its creators,\" which he calls a \"youthful cab-driver's\" perspective. Cohen concludes that \"o control the reference sources that people use is to control the way people comprehend the world. Wikipedia may have a benign, even trivial face, but underneath may lie a more sinister and subtle threat to freedom of thought.\" That freedom is undermined by what he sees as what matters on Wikipedia, \"not your sources but the 'support of the community'.\"\n",
            "paragraph36": "Researchers from Washington University in St. Louis developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact.\n",
            "paragraph37": "Critics also point to the tendency to cover topics in detail disproportionate to their importance. For example, Stephen Colbert once mockingly praised Wikipedia for having a longer entry on 'lightsabers' than it does on the 'printing press'. Dale Hoiberg, the editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica, said \"People write of things they're interested in, and so many subjects don't get covered; and news events get covered in great detail. In the past, the entry on Hurricane Frances was more than five times the length of that on Chinese art, and the entry on Coronation Street was twice as long as the article on Tony Blair.\"\n",
            "paragraph38": "This approach of comparing two articles, one about a traditionally encyclopedic subject and the other about one more popular with the crowd, has been called \"wikigroaning\". A defense of inclusion criteria is that the encyclopedia's longer coverage of pop culture does not deprive the more \"worthy\" or serious subjects of space.\n",
            "paragraph39": "Wikipedia's notability guidelines, which are used by editors to determine if a subject merits its own article, and the application thereof, are the subject of much criticism. A Wikipedia editor rejected a draft article about Donna Strickland before she won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, because no independent sources were given to show that Strickland was sufficiently notable by Wikipedia's standards. Journalists highlighted this as an indicator of the limited visibility of women in science compared to their male colleagues.\n",
            "paragraph40": "The gender bias on Wikipedia is well documented, and has prompted a movement to increase the number of notable women on Wikipedia through the Women in Red WikiProject. In an article entitled \"Seeking Disambiguation\", Annalisa Merelli interviewed Catalina Cruz, a candidate for office in Queens, New York in the 2018 election who had the notorious SEO disadvantage of having the same name as a porn star with a Wikipedia page. Merelli also interviewed the Wikipedia editor who wrote the candidate's ill-fated article (which was deleted, then restored, after she won the election). She described the Articles for Deletion process, and pointed to other candidates who had pages on the English Wikipedia despite never having held office.\n",
            "paragraph41": "Novelist Nicholson Baker, critical of deletionism, writes: \"There are quires, reams, bales of controversy over what constitutes notability in Wikipedia: nobody will ever sort it out.\"\n",
            "paragraph42": "Journalist Timothy Noah wrote of his treatment: \"Wikipedia's notability policy resembles U.S. immigration policy before 9/11: stringent rules, spotty enforcement\". In the same article, Noah mentions that the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Stacy Schiff was not considered notable enough for a Wikipedia entry until she wrote her article \"Know it All\" about the Wikipedia Essjay controversy.\n",
            "paragraph43": "On a more generic level, a 2014 study found no correlation between characteristics of a given Wikipedia page about an academic and the academic's notability as determined by citation counts. The metrics of each Wikipedia page examined included length, number of links to the page from other articles, and number of edits made to the page. This study also found that Wikipedia did not cover notable ISI highly cited researchers properly.\n",
            "paragraph44": "In 2020, Wikipedia was criticized for the amount of time it took for an article about Theresa Greenfield, a candidate for the 2020 United States Senate election in Iowa, to leave Wikipedia's Articles for Creation process and become published. Particularly, the criteria for notability were criticized, with The Washington Post reporting: \"Greenfield is an uniquely tricky case for Wikipedia because she doesn’t have the background that most candidates for major political office typically have (like prior government experience or prominence in business). Even if Wikipedia editors could recognize she was prominent, she had a hard time meeting the official criteria for notability.\" Jimmy Wales also criticized the long process on his talk page.\n",
            "paragraph45": "U.S. commentators, mostly politically conservative ones, have suggested that a politically liberal viewpoint is predominant in the English Wikipedia. Andrew Schlafly created Conservapedia because of his perception that Wikipedia contained a liberal bias. Conservapedia's editors have compiled a list of alleged examples of liberal bias in Wikipedia. In 2007, an article in The Christian Post criticised Wikipedia's coverage of intelligent design, saying it was biased and hypocritical. Lawrence Solomon of National Review considered the Wikipedia articles on subjects like global warming, intelligent design, and Roe v. Wade all to be slanted in favor of liberal views. In a September 2010 issue of the conservative weekly Human Events, Rowan Scarborough presented a critique of Wikipedia's coverage of American politicians prominent in the approaching U.S. midterm elections as evidence of systemic liberal bias. Scarborough compares the biographical articles of liberal and conservative opponents in Senate races in the Alaska Republican primary and the Delaware and Nevada general election, emphasizing the quantity of negative coverage of Tea Party movement-endorsed candidates. He also cites criticism by Lawrence Solomon and quotes in full the lead section of Wikipedia's article on Conservapedia as evidence of an underlying bias.\n",
            "paragraph46": "In 2006, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said: \"The Wikipedia community is very diverse, from liberal to conservative to libertarian and beyond. If averages mattered, and due to the nature of the wiki software (no voting) they almost certainly don't, I would say that the Wikipedia community is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population on average, because we are global and the international community of English speakers is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population. There are no data or surveys to back that.\" Shane Greenstein and Feng Zhu analyzed 2012 era Wikipedia articles on U.S. politics, going back a decade, and wrote a study arguing the more contributors there were to an article, the less biased the article would be, and that –  based on a study of frequent collocations –  fewer articles \"leaned Democrat\" than was the case in Wikipedia's early years. Sorin Adam Matei, a professor at Purdue University, said that \"for certain political topics, there's a central-left bias. There's also a slight, when it comes to more political topics, counter-cultural bias. It's not across the board, and it's not for all things.\"\n",
            "paragraph47": "In November 2021, the English Wikipedia's entry for \"Mass killings under communist regimes\" was nominated for deletion, with some editors arguing that it has \"a biased 'anti-Communist' point of view\", that \"it should not resort to 'simplistic presuppositions that events are driven by any specific ideology'\", and that \"by combining different elements of research to create a 'synthesis', this constitutes original research and therefore breaches Wikipedia rules.\" This was criticized by historian Robert Tombs, who called it \"morally indefensible, at least as bad as Holocaust denial, because 'linking ideology and killing' is the very core of why these things are important. I have read the Wikipedia page, and it seems to me careful and balanced. Therefore attempts to remove it can only be ideologically motivated – to whitewash Communism.\" Other Wikipedia editors and users on social media opposed the deletion of the article. On December 1, 2021, a panel of four administrators found that the discussion yielded no consensus, meaning that the status quo was retained, and the article was not deleted.\n",
            "paragraph48": "In 2008, Tim Anderson, a senior lecturer in political economy at the University of Sydney, said Wikipedia administrators display an American-focused bias in their interactions with editors and their determinations of which sources are appropriate for use on the site. Anderson was outraged after several of the sources he used in his edits to the Hugo Chávez article, including Venezuela Analysis and Z Magazine, were disallowed as \"unusable\". Anderson also described Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy to ZDNet Australia as \"a facade\" and that Wikipedia \"hides behind a reliance on corporate media editorials\".\n",
            "paragraph49": "Wikipedia has been charged with having a systemic racial bias in its coverage, due to an underrepresentation of people of colour as editors. The President of Wikimedia D.C., James Hare, noted that \"a lot of black history is left out\" of Wikipedia, due to articles predominately being written by white editors. Articles that do exist on African topics are, according to some critics, largely edited by editors from Europe and North America and thus reflect their knowledge and consumption of media, which \"tend to perpetuate a negative image\" of Africa. Maira Liriano, of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, has argued that the lack of information regarding black history on Wikipedia \"makes it seem like it's not important.\" San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murguía has stressed how it is important for Latinos to be part of Wikipedia \"because it is a major source of where people get their information.\" In 2010, an analysis of Wikipedia edits revealed that Asia, as the most populous continent, was represented in only 16.67% of edits. Africa (6.35%) and South America (2.58%) were equally underrepresented.\n",
            "paragraph50": "In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized Wikipedia for being \"vulnerable to manipulation by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and racist academics seeking a wider audience for extreme views.\" According to the SPLC, \"ivil POV-pushers can disrupt the editing process by engaging other users in tedious and frustrating debates or tie up administrators in endless rounds of mediation. Users who fall into this category include racialist academics and members of the human biodiversity, or HBD, blogging community. ... In recent years, the proliferation of far-right online spaces, such as white nationalist forums, alt-right boards and HBD blogs, has created a readymade pool of users that can be recruited to edit on Wikipedia en masse. ... The presence of white nationalists and other far-right extremists on Wikipedia is an ongoing problem that is unlikely to go away in the near future given the rightward political shift in countries where the majority of the site’s users live. The SPLC cited the article \"Race and intelligence\" as an example of the alt-right influence on Wikipedia, stating that at that time the article presented a \"false balance\" between fringe racialist views and the \"mainstream perspective in psychology.\"\n",

Gender bias on Wikipedia refers to the finding that between 84 and 91 percent of Wikipedia editors are male, which allegedly leads to systemic bias. Wikipedia has been criticized by some journalists and academics for lacking not only women contributors but also extensive and in-depth encyclopedic attention to many topics regarding gender. Sue Gardner, former executive director of the Foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia \"as good as it could be\". Factors cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the \"obsessive fact-loving realm\", associations with the \"hard-driving hacker crowd\", and the necessity to be \"open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists.\"\n",
            "paragraph52": "In 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation set a goal of increasing the proportion of female contributors to 25 percent by 2015. In August 2013, Gardner conceded defeat: \"I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation.\" In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales acknowledged in a BBC interview the failure of Wikipedia to fix the gender gap and announced the Wikimedia Foundation's plans for \"doubling down\" on the issue.

            "paragraph56": "Wikipedia has been criticized for issues related to bias in firearms-related articles. According to critics, systematic bias arises from the tendency of the editors most active in maintaining firearms-related articles to also be gun enthusiasts, and firearms-related articles are dominated by technical information while issues of the social impact and regulation of firearms are relegated to separate articles. Communications were facilitated by a \"WikiProject,\" called \"WikiProject Firearms\", an on-wiki group of editors with a common interest. The alleged pro-gun bias drew increased attention after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018. The Wikimedia Foundation defended itself from allegations of being host to opinion-influencing campaigns of pro-gun groups, saying that the contents are always being updated and improved.\n",

In response, Jimmy Wales said Wikipedia covers only works that are published in respectable scientific journals.\n",
            "paragraph58": "Wikipedia has been accused of being biased against views outside of the scientific mainstream due to influence from the skeptical movement.  Social scientist Brian Martin examined the influence of skeptics on Wikipedia by looking for parallels between Wikipedia entries and characteristic techniques used by skeptics, finding that the result \"does not prove that Skeptics are shaping Wikipedia but is compatible with that possibility.\"\n",
            "subtitle4": "Sexual content",
            "paragraph59": "Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing graphic sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation as well as photos from hardcore pornographic films found on its articles.

            "paragraph60": "The Wikipedia article Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit, nongovernment-affiliated organization, added the article to its blacklist, criticizing the inclusion of the picture as \"distasteful\". As a result, access to the article was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom. Seth Finkelstein writing for The Guardian argues that the debate over the album cover masks a structural lack of accountability on Wikipedia, in particular when it comes to sexual content. For example, the deletion by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales of images of lolicon versions of the character Wikipe-tan created a minor controversy on the topic. The deletion was taken as endorsement of the non-lolicon images of Wikipe-tan, which Wales later had to explicitly deny: \"I don't like Wikipe-tan and never have.\" Finkelstein sees Wikipedia as composed of fiefdoms, which makes it difficult for the Wikipedia community to deal with such issues, and sometimes necessitates top-down intervention.\n",

Wikipedia has a range of tools available to users and administrators in order to fight against vandalism, including blocking and banning of vandals and automated bots that detect and repair vandalism. Supporters of the project argue that the vast majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted within a short time, and a study by Fernanda Viégas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM Research found that most vandal edits were reverted within around five minutes; however they state that \"it is essentially impossible to find a crisp definition of vandalism.\" While most instances of page blanking or the addition of offensive material are soon reverted, less obvious vandalism, or vandalism to a little viewed article, has remained for longer periods.\n",

It \"is not yet possible to anticipate the path of the common law or governmental regulation\" regarding this problem.\n",

More specifically, the court ordered that the URL within the German .de domain (http://www.wikipedia.de/) may no longer redirect to the encyclopedia's servers in Florida at http://de.wikipedia.org although German readers were still able to use the US-based URL directly, and there was virtually no loss of access on their part. The court order arose out of a lawsuit filed by Floricic's parents, demanding that their son's surname be removed from Wikipedia. The next month on February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents were being violated.\n"

Reports in The Washington Post, Slate and Social Text described these articles as \"flawed\" or factually inaccurate, pointing out that the Arbitration case had not concluded as at the time of publishing; no editor had been banned. After the result was published, Gawker wrote that \"ArbCom ruled to punish six editors who could be broadly classified as 'anti-Gamergate' and five who are 'pro-Gamergate'.\" All of the supposed \"Five Horsemen\"[non sequitur] were among the editors punished, with one of them being the sole editor banned due to this case. An article called \"ArbitrationGate\" regarding this situation was created (and quickly deleted) on Wikipedia, while The Guardian later issued a correction to their article. The Committee and the Wikimedia Foundation issued press statements that the Gamergate case was in response to the atmosphere of the Gamergate article resembling a \"battlefield\" due to \"various sides of the discussion  violated community policies and guidelines on conduct\", and that the committee was fulfilling its role to \"uphold a civil, constructive atmosphere\" on Wikipedia.

According to The Economist magazine (2008), \"The behaviour of Wikipedia's self-appointed deletionist guardians, who excise anything that does not meet their standards, justifying their actions with a blizzard of acronyms, is now known as 'wiki-lawyering'.\" In regards to the decline in the number of Wikipedia editors since the 2007 policy changes, another study stated this was partly down to the way \"in which newcomers are rudely greeted by automated quality control systems and are overwhelmed by the complexity of the rule system.\"\n",
