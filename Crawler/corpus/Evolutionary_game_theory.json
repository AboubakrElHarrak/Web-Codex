A contest involves players, all of whom have a choice of moves. Games can be a single round or repetitive. The approach a player takes in making his moves constitutes his strategy. Rules govern the outcome for the moves taken by the players, and outcomes produce payoffs for the players; rules and resulting payoffs can be expressed as decision trees or in a payoff matrix. Classical theory requires the players to make rational choices. Each player must consider the strategic analysis that his opponents are making to make his own choice of moves.\n",

John Maynard Smith considered that incompatible with Darwinian thought, where selection occurs at an individual level, so self-interest is rewarded while seeking the common good is not. Maynard Smith, a mathematical biologist, turned to game theory as suggested by George Price, though Richard Lewontin's attempts to use the theory had failed.\n",

The results of a game show how good that strategy was, just as evolution tests alternative strategies for the ability to survive and reproduce. In biology, strategies are genetically inherited traits that control an individual's action, analogous with computer programs.  The success of a strategy is determined by how good the strategy is in the presence of competing strategies (including itself), and of the frequency with which those strategies are used. Maynard Smith described his work in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Participants aim to produce as many replicas of themselves as they can, and the payoff is in units of fitness (relative worth in being able to reproduce). It is always a multi-player game with many competitors.  Rules include replicator dynamics, in other words how the fitter players will spawn more replicas of themselves into the population and how the less fit will be culled, in a replicator equation. The replicator dynamics models heredity but not mutation, and assumes asexual reproduction for the sake of simplicity. Games are run repetitively with no terminating conditions. Results include the dynamics of changes in the population, the success of strategies, and any equilibrium states reached. Unlike in classical game theory, players do not choose their strategy and cannot change it: they are born with a strategy and their offspring inherit that same strategy.\n"

The system process has four phases:  1) The model (as evolution itself) deals with a population (Pn).  The population will exhibit variation among competing individuals.  In the model this competition is represented by the game.  2) The game tests the strategies of the individuals under the rules of the game.  These rules produce different payoffs – in units of fitness (the production rate of offspring).  The contesting individuals meet in pairwise contests with others, normally in a highly mixed distribution of the population.  The mix of strategies in the population affects the payoff results by altering the odds that any individual may meet up in contests with various strategies. The individuals leave the game pairwise contest with a resulting fitness determined by the contest outcome, represented in a payoff matrix.  3) Based on this resulting fitness each member of the population then undergoes replication or culling determined by the exact mathematics of the replicator dynamics process.  This overall process then produces a new generation P(n+1).  Each surviving individual now has a new fitness level determined by the game result.  4) The new generation then takes the place of the previous one and the cycle repeats. The population mix may converge to an evolutionarily stable state that cannot be invaded by any mutant strategy.\n\t"

            "paragraph1": "Evolutionary game theory encompasses Darwinian evolution, including competition (the game), natural selection (replicator dynamics), and heredity. Evolutionary game theory has contributed to the understanding of group selection, sexual selection, altruism, parental care, co-evolution, and ecological dynamics. Many counter-intuitive situations in these areas have been put on a firm mathematical footing by the use of these models.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The common way to study the evolutionary dynamics in games is through replicator equations. These show the growth rate of the proportion of organisms using a certain strategy and  that rate is equal to the difference between the average payoff of that strategy and the average payoff of the population as a whole. Continuous replicator equations assume infinite populations, continuous time, complete mixing and that strategies breed true. The attractors (stable fixed points) of the equations are equivalent with evolutionarily stable states.  A strategy which can survive all \"mutant\" strategies is considered evolutionarily stable. In the context of animal behavior, this usually means such strategies are programmed and heavily influenced by genetics, thus making any player or organism's strategy determined by these biological factors.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Evolutionary games are mathematical objects with different rules, payoffs, and mathematical behaviours. Each \"game\" represents different problems that organisms have to deal with, and the strategies they might adopt to survive and reproduce. Evolutionary games are often given colourful names and cover stories which describe the general situation of a particular game. Representative games include hawk-dove, war of attrition, stag hunt, producer-scrounger, tragedy of the commons, and prisoner's dilemma. Strategies for these games include hawk, dove, bourgeois, prober, defector, assessor, and retaliator. The various strategies compete under the particular game's rules, and the mathematics are used to determine the results and behaviours.\n",

            },
            "paragraph4": "The first game that Maynard Smith analysed is the classic hawk dove game. It was conceived to analyse Lorenz and Tinbergen's problem, a contest over a shareable resource. The contestants can be either  a hawk or a dove. These are two subtypes or morphs of one species with different strategies. The hawk first displays aggression, then escalates into a fight until it either wins or is injured (loses). The dove first displays aggression, but if faced with major escalation runs for safety. If not faced with such escalation, the dove attempts to share the resource.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Given that the resource is given the value V, the damage from losing a fight is given cost C:\n",
            "ul1": "If a hawk meets a dove, the hawk gets the full resource V\nIf a hawk meets a hawk, half the time they win, half the time they lose, so the average outcome is then V/2 minus C/2\nIf a dove meets a hawk, the dove will back off and get nothing – 0\nIf a dove meets a dove, both share the resource and get V/2\n",
            "paragraph6": "The actual payoff, however, depends on the probability of meeting a hawk or dove, which in turn is a representation of the percentage of hawks and doves in the population when a particular contest takes place. That, in turn, is determined by the results of all of the previous contests. If the cost of losing C is greater than the value of winning V (the normal situation in the natural world) the mathematics ends in an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a mix of the two strategies where the population of hawks is V/C. The population regresses to this equilibrium point if any new hawks or doves make a temporary perturbation in the population.\nThe solution of the hawk dove game explains why most animal contests involve only ritual fighting behaviours in contests rather than outright battles. The result does not at all depend on \"good of the species\" behaviours as suggested by Lorenz, but solely on the implication of actions of so-called selfish genes.\n",
            "subtitle3": "War of attrition",
            "paragraph7": "In the hawk dove game the resource is shareable, which gives payoffs to both doves meeting in a pairwise contest. Where the resource is not shareable, but an alternative resource might be available by backing off and trying elsewhere, pure hawk or dove strategies are less effective. If an unshareable resource is combined with a high cost of losing a contest (injury or possible death) both hawk and dove payoffs are further diminished.  A safer strategy of lower cost display, bluffing and waiting to win, is then viable – a bluffer strategy. The game then becomes one of accumulating costs, either the costs of displaying or the costs of prolonged unresolved engagement. It is effectively an auction; the winner is the contestant who will swallow the greater cost while the loser gets the same cost as the winner but no resource. The resulting evolutionary game theory mathematics lead to an optimal strategy of timed bluffing.\n",

            "paragraph8": "This is because in the war of attrition any strategy that is unwavering and predictable is unstable, because it will ultimately be displaced by a mutant strategy which relies on the fact that it can best the existing predictable strategy by investing an extra small delta of waiting resource to ensure that it wins. Therefore, only a random unpredictable strategy can maintain itself in a population of bluffers. The contestants in effect choose an acceptable cost to be incurred related to the value of the resource being sought, effectively making a random bid as part of a mixed strategy (a strategy where a contestant has several, or even many, possible actions in their strategy). This implements a distribution of bids for a resource of specific value V, where the bid for any specific contest is chosen at random from that distribution.  The distribution (an ESS) can be computed using the Bishop-Cannings theorem, which holds true for any mixed-strategy ESS. The distribution function in these contests was determined by Parker and Thompson to be:\n",

            "paragraph10": "as shown in the adjacent graph.  The intuitive sense that greater values of resource sought leads to greater waiting times is borne out.

            "paragraph11": "In the war of attrition there must be nothing that signals the size of a bid to an opponent, otherwise the opponent can use the cue in an effective counter-strategy.  There is however a mutant strategy which can better a bluffer in the war of attrition game if a suitable asymmetry exists, the bourgeois strategy. Bourgeois uses an asymmetry of some sort to break the deadlock. In nature one such asymmetry is possession of a resource. The strategy is to play a hawk if in possession of the resource, but to display then retreat if not in possession.  This requires greater cognitive capability than hawk, but bourgeois is common in many animal contests, such as in contests among mantis shrimps and among speckled wood butterflies.\n",

Where social influences apply, competitors have four possible alternatives for strategic interaction.  This is shown on the adjacent figure, where a plus sign represents a benefit and a minus sign represents a cost.\n",
            "ul2": "In a cooperative or mutualistic relationship both \"donor\" and \"recipient\" are almost indistinguishable as both gain a benefit in the game by co-operating, i.e. the pair are in a game-wise situation where both can gain by executing a certain strategy,  or alternatively both must act in  concert because of some encompassing  constraints that effectively puts them  \"in the same boat\".\nIn an altruistic relationship the donor, at a cost to themself provides a benefit to the recipient.  In the general case the recipient will have a kin relationship to the donor and the donation is one-way.  Behaviours where benefits are donated alternatively (in both directions) at a cost, are often called \"altruistic\", but on analysis such \"altruism\" can be seen to arise from optimised  \"selfish\" strategies.\nSpite is essentially a \"reversed\" form of altruism where an ally is aided by damaging the ally's competitors.  The general case is that the ally is kin related and the benefit is an easier competitive environment for the ally.   Note: George Price, one of the early mathematical modellers of both altruism and spite, found this equivalence particularly disturbing at an emotional level.[19]\nSelfishness is the base criteria of all strategic choice from a game theory perspective – strategies not aimed at self-survival and self-replication are not long for any game. Critically however, this situation is impacted by the fact that competition is taking place on multiple levels  – i.e. at a genetic, an individual and a group level.\n"

But individuals live only through one game cycle, and instead it is the strategies that really contest with one another over the duration of these many-generation games.  So it is ultimately genes that play out a full contest – selfish genes of strategy.  The contesting genes are present in an individual and to a degree in all of the individual's kin.  This can sometimes profoundly affect which strategies survive, especially with issues of cooperation and defection. William Hamilton, known for his theory of kin selection, explored many of these cases using game-theoretic models. Kin-related treatment of game contests helps to explain many aspects of the behaviour of social insects, the altruistic behaviour in parent-offspring interactions, mutual protection behaviours, and co-operative care of offspring. For such games, Hamilton defined an extended form of fitness – inclusive fitness, which includes an individual's offspring as well as any offspring equivalents found in kin.\n",

But universal selection at the group level (for the good of the species, not the individual) fails to pass the test of the mathematics of game theory and is certainly not the general case in nature. Yet in many social animals, altruistic behaviour exists. The solution to this problem can be found in the application of evolutionary game theory to the prisoner's dilemma game – a game which tests the payoffs of cooperating or in defecting from cooperation.  It is the most studied game in all of game theory.\n",

            "paragraph3": "However the blue throats cannot overcome the more aggressive orange throats. Later work showed that the blue males are altruistic to other blue males, with three key traits:  they signal with blue color,  they recognize and settle next to other (unrelated) blue males, and  they will even defend their partner against orange, to the death. This is the hallmark of another game of cooperation that involves a green-beard effect.\n",

Here, r is the Malthusian parameter governing exponential growth, and K is the carrying capacity of the population. Orange females have larger clutches and smaller offspring and do well at low density. Yellow females (and blue) have smaller clutches and larger offspring and do better when the population exceeds carrying capacity and the population crashes to low density. The orange then takes over and this generates perpetual cycles of orange and yellow tightly tied to population density. The idea of cycles due to density regulation of two strategies originated with Dennis Chitty, who worked on rodents, ergo these kinds of games lead to \"Chitty cycles\". There are games within games within games embedded in natural populations. These drive RPS cycles in the males with a periodicity of four years and r-K cycles in females with a periodicity of two years.\n",

The RPS game in male side-blotched lizards does not have an ESS, but it has a Nash equilibrium (NE) with endless orbits around the NE attractor. Since that time many other three-strategy polymorphisms have been discovered in lizards and some of these have RPS dynamics merging the male game and density regulation game in a single sex (males). More recently, mammals have been shown to harbour the same RPS game in males and r-K game in females, with coat-colour polymorphisms and behaviours that drive cycles. This game is also linked to the evolution of male care in rodents, and monogamy, and drives speciation rates. There are r-K strategy games linked to rodent population cycles (and lizard cycles).\n",

Regarding this issue Darwin wrote to a colleague \"The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick.\"  It is the mathematics of evolutionary game theory, which has not only explained the existence of altruism, but also explains the totally counterintuitive existence of the peacock's tail and other such biological encumbrances.\n",
            "paragraph2": "On analysis, problems of biological life are not at all unlike the problems that define economics – eating (akin to resource acquisition and management), survival (competitive strategy) and reproduction (investment, risk and return). Game theory was originally conceived as a mathematical analysis of economic processes and indeed this is why it has proven so useful in explaining so many biological behaviours.  One important further refinement of the evolutionary game theory model that has economic overtones rests on the analysis of costs.  A simple model of cost assumes that all competitors suffer the same penalty imposed by the game costs, but this is not the case. More successful players will be endowed with or will have accumulated a higher \"wealth reserve\" or \"affordability\" than less-successful players.  This wealth effect in evolutionary game theory is represented mathematically by \"resource holding potential (RHP)\" and shows that the effective cost to a competitor with a higher RHP are not as great as for a competitor with a lower RHP.   As a higher RHP individual is a more desirable mate in producing potentially successful offspring, it is only logical that with sexual selection RHP should have evolved to be signalled in some way by the competing rivals, and for this to work this signalling must be done honestly. Amotz Zahavi has developed this thinking in what is known as the \"handicap principle\", where superior competitors signal their superiority by a costly display.  As higher RHP individuals can properly afford such a costly display this signalling is inherently honest, and can be taken as such by the signal receiver.  In nature this is illustrated than in the costly plumage of the peacock.  The mathematical proof of the handicap principle was developed by Alan Grafen using evolutionary game-theoretic modelling.\n"

Examples include predator-prey competition and host-parasite co-evolution, as well as mutualism.  Evolutionary game models have been created for pairwise and multi-species coevolutionary systems. The general dynamic differs between competitive systems and mutualistic systems.\n",
            "paragraph3": "In competitive (non-mutualistic) inter-species coevolutionary system the species are involved in an arms race – where adaptations that are better at competing against the other species tend to be preserved. Both game payoffs and replicator dynamics reflect this. This leads to a Red Queen dynamic where the protagonists must \"run as fast as they can to just stay in one place\".\n",
            "paragraph4": "A number of evolutionary game theory models have been produced to encompass coevolutionary situations. A key factor applicable in these coevolutionary systems is the continuous adaptation of strategy in such arms races. Coevolutionary modelling therefore often includes genetic algorithms to reflect mutational effects, while computers simulate the dynamics of the overall coevolutionary game.   The resulting dynamics are studied as various parameters are modified.  Because several variables are simultaneously at play, solutions become the province of multi-variable optimisation. The mathematical criteria of determining stable points are Pareto efficiency and Pareto dominance, a measure of solution optimality peaks in multivariable systems.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Carl Bergstrom and Michael Lachmann apply evolutionary game theory to the division of benefits in mutualistic interactions between organisms.

With this understanding in place it is then appropriate to see if other, more subtle, parameters (second order effects) further impact the primary behaviours or shape additional behaviours in the system.   Following Maynard Smith's seminal work in evolutionary game theory, the subject has had a number of very significant extensions which have shed more light on understanding evolutionary dynamics, particularly in the area of altruistic behaviors.

This model is useful in showing how pockets of co-operators can invade and introduce altruism in the Prisoners Dilemma game, where Tit for Tat (TFT) is a Nash Equilibrium but NOT also an ESS.

Unless a probability measure of reputation is available in Prisoners Dilemma only direct reciprocity can be achieved.  With this information indirect reciprocity is also supported.\n",
