On Feb 6, 2017, Comscore announced they would not meet the NASDAQ-imposed deadline to \"complete its financial restatement and regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\" Because of this missed deadline, \"Comscore's common stock may be suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq.\"  If Comscore is delisted from NASDAQ and their trading is suspended, they advise they intend to \"be quoted on the OTC Markets.\" In November 2017, According to the reports, Gian Fulgoni co-founder and CEO retired.\n",

            "paragraph6": "On April 1, 2019, CEO Bryan Wiener announced that he, along with president Sarah Hofstetter would be stepping down from their respective roles at Comscore, citing irreconcilable differences in strategy with the company's board.\n",

            "subtitle1": "Mergers and acquisitions",
            "paragraph8": "Comscore acquired Media Metrix in a deal announced in June 2002. Earlier, the Federal Trade Commission announced it would block a bid by NetRatings to acquire Media Metrix.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Media Metrix originated as PC Meter, a business unit of market research company NPD Group, and began publishing statistics in January 1996. In July 1997, it changed its name to Media Metrix.  In October 1998, Media Metrix merged with a rival, Relevant Knowledge. The company went public as NASDAQ:MMXI in May 1999, reaching a market cap of $135 million on its first day of trading. In June 2000, the company acquired Jupiter Communications for $414 million in stock and changed its name to Jupiter Media Metrix.

            "title": "Data collection and reporting",
            "paragraph1": "Comscore maintains a group of users who have monitoring software (with brands including PermissionResearch, OpinionSquare and VoiceFive Networks) installed on their computers.[citation needed] In exchange for joining the Comscore research panels, users are presented with various benefits, including computer security software, Internet data storage, virus scanning, and chances to win cash or prizes.[citation needed]\n",
            "paragraph2": "Comscore estimates that two million users are part of the monitoring program. However, self-selected populations, no matter how large, may not be representative of the population as a whole. To obtain the most accurate data, Comscore adjusts the statistics using weights to make sure that each population segment is adequately represented. To calculate these weights, Comscore regularly recruits panelists using random digit dialing and other offline recruiting methods to accurately determine how many users are online, aggregated by geography, income, and age. Correcting the Comscore data requires having accurate demographics about the larger pool of users. However, some Comscore users are recruited without being asked to give demographic information and, in other cases, users may not be truthful about their demographics. To ensure the accuracy of the data, Comscore verifies its users' demographics during the course of measuring statistical data.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The corrected data is used to generate reports on topics ranging from web traffic to video streaming activity and consumer buying power.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In April 2020, Comscore launched a faster local TV rating service -- with a turnaround of 48 hours, as opposed to the previous two weeks span it takes TV stations to get TV ratings data.\n"

        {
            "title": "Unified Digital Measurement",
            "paragraph1": "In May 2009, Comscore introduced Unified Digital Measurement (UDM), a digital audience measurement tool that blended panel and census-based measurement approaches. The methodology calculates audience reach without being affected by cookie deletion and cookie blocking/rejection.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Campaign measurement",
            "paragraph1": "Comscore debuted Campaign Essentials in 2010 to measure how digital campaigns are reaching their audiences. In March 2012, Comscore launched validated Campaign Essentials (vCE), which introduced the notion of “validated” impressions. In January 2013, Comscore announced that it had evaluated 4,000 campaigns for clients covering more than 75 advertising agencies.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Criticism",
            "paragraph1": "In 2006, Ben Edelman, a Harvard researcher, alleged that there were cases where Comscore software had been installed on users' computers without their knowledge. Comscore admitted that it was in discussion with a spyware firm called DollarRevenue but said that no contract was ever signed, and that once it realized DollarRevenue was distributing Comscore's software, months later, it took steps to prevent the DollarRevenue-distributed software from sending data to Comscore. Stanford IT notes that the monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program iMesh without users being aware of it, although Comscore's relationship with iMesh was short-lived and occurred several years ago.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In the past, the software forwarded users' internet traffic through Comscore proxy servers, provoking criticism about speed performance. As a result, several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers. In response to these concerns, Comscore no longer uses this technology.[citation needed]\n",
            "paragraph3": "In June 2010, a warning about Mac Spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers, from security company Intego was reported in the media and implicated VoiceFive, Inc. as the source of certain alleged spyware software.  VoiceFive, Inc. has become compliant with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n",
            "paragraph4": "Additionally, noted blogger and angel investor Jason Calacanis claimed that Comscore was running an 'extorting ring' by vastly undercounting publisher traffic numbers and forcing them to pay fees for direct measurement via a tracking pixel. Comscore responded to these allegations by offering their direct measurement tracking pixel to long-tail web publishers for free.\n",
            "subtitle1": "SEC findings",
            "paragraph5": "In 2019, Comscore Inc. and its former CEO Serge Matta were charged with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to overstate revenue by approximately $50 million and making false and misleading statements about key performance metrics. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) found that Comscore and Matta made false and misleading public disclosures regarding the company’s customer base and flagship product and that Matta lied to Comscore's internal accountants and external audit firm in order. This enabled Comscore to artificially exceed its analysts' consensus revenue target in seven consecutive quarters and create the illusion of smooth and steady growth in Comscore's business.\n"
