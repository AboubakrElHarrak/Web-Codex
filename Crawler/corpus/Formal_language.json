            "paragraph2": "The alphabet of a formal language consists of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language. Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas. A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, which consists of its formation rules.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The field of formal language theory studies primarily the purely syntactical aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.\nIn computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.\n"

            "paragraph1": "The first use of formal language is thought to be Gottlob Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift, meaning \"concept writing\", which described a \"formal language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought.\"\n",

            "title": "Words over an alphabet",
            "paragraph1": "An alphabet, in the context of formal languages, can be any set, although it often makes sense to use an alphabet in the usual sense of the word, or more generally a character set such as ASCII or Unicode.  The elements of an alphabet are called its letters.  An alphabet may contain an infinite number of elements;[note 1] however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.\n",
            "paragraph2": "A word over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., string) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet Σ is usually denoted by Σ* (using the Kleene star). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the empty word, which is often denoted by e, ε, λ or even Λ. By concatenation one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.\n",
            "paragraph3": "In some applications, especially in logic, the alphabet is also known as the vocabulary and words are known as formulas or sentences; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Definition",
            "paragraph1": "A formal language L over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ*, that is, a set of words over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with natural languages, the adjective \"formal\" is often omitted as redundant.\n",
            "paragraph3": "While formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept \"formal language\" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less.  In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as regular languages or context-free languages.  The notion of a formal grammar may be closer to the intuitive concept of a \"language,\" one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.\n"

            "title": "Examples",
            "paragraph1": "The following rules describe a formal language L over the alphabet Σ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, =}:\n",
            "ul1": "Every nonempty string that does not contain \"+\" or \"=\" and does not start with \"0\" is in L.\nThe string \"0\" is in L.\nA string containing \"=\" is in L if and only if there is exactly one \"=\", and it separates two valid strings of L.\nA string containing \"+\" but not \"=\" is in L if and only if every \"+\" in the string separates two valid strings of L.\nNo string is in L other than those implied by the previous rules.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Under these rules, the string \"23+4=555\" is in L, but the string \"=234=+\" is not. This formal language expresses natural numbers, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their syntax), not what they mean (semantics). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that \"0\" means the number zero,   \"+\" means addition, \"23+4=555\" is false, etc.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Constructions",
            "paragraph3": "For finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language L as just L = {a, b, ab, cba}. The degenerate case of this construction is the empty language, which contains no words at all (L = ∅).\n",
            "paragraph4": "However, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as Σ = {a, b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: \"a\", \"abb\", \"ababba\", \"aaababbbbaab\", .... Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing L = {a, b, ab, cba}. Here are some examples of formal languages:\n",
            "ul2": "L = Σ*, the set of all words over Σ;\nL = {a}* = {an}, where n ranges over the natural numbers and \"an\" means \"a\" repeated n times (this is the set of words consisting only of the symbol \"a\");\nthe set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language (the syntax of which is usually defined by a context-free grammar);\nthe set of inputs upon which a certain Turing machine halts; or\nthe set of maximal strings of alphanumeric ASCII characters on this line, i.e., the set {the, set, of, maximal, strings, alphanumeric, ASCII, characters, on, this, line, i, e}.\n"

            "paragraph1": "Formal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as\n",
            "ul1": "those strings generated by some formal grammar;\nthose strings described or matched by a particular regular expression;\nthose strings accepted by some automaton, such as a Turing machine or finite-state automaton;\nthose strings for which some decision procedure (an algorithm that asks a sequence of related YES/NO questions) produces the answer YES.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Typical questions asked about such formalisms include:\n",
            "ul2": "What is their expressive power? (Can formalism X describe every language that formalism Y can describe? Can it describe other languages?)\nWhat is their recognizability? (How difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a language described by formalism X?)\nWhat is their comparability? (How difficult is it to decide whether two languages, one described in formalism X and one in formalism Y, or in X again, are actually the same language?).\n",
            "paragraph3": "Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is \"it cannot be done at all\", or \"it is extremely expensive\" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of computability theory and complexity theory. Formal languages may be classified in the Chomsky hierarchy based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing automaton. Context-free grammars and regular grammars provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of parsing, and are widely used in practical applications.\n"

A lexical analyzer, sometimes generated by a tool like lex, identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. identifiers or keywords, numeric and string literals, punctuation and operator symbols, which are themselves specified by a simpler formal language, usually by means of regular expressions. At the most basic conceptual level, a parser, sometimes generated by a parser generator like yacc, attempts to decide if the source program is syntactically valid, that is if it is well formed with respect to the programming language grammar for which the compiler was built.\n",

Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an abstract syntax tree.

In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within mathematical structures, and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a model for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.\n"
