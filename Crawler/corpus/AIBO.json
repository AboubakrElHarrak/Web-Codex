            "paragraph1": "AIBO (stylized aibo, Artificial Intelligence Robot, homonymous with aibō (相棒), \"pal\" or \"partner\" in Japanese) is a series of robotic dogs designed and manufactured by Sony. Sony announced a prototype Aibo in mid-1998. The first consumer model was introduced on 11 May 1999. New models were released every year until 2006. Although most models were dogs, other inspirations included lion-cubs or huskies/jack-russel terrier/bull terrier, and space explorer, and only the ERS-7 version, ERS-110/111 and ERS-1000 versions was explicitly a \"robotic dog\", but the 210 can also be considered a dog due to its jack-russel terrier appearance and cute puppy face.\nIn 2006, AIBO was added into the Carnegie Mellon University Robot Hall of Fame.\n",
            "paragraph2": "On 26 January 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products in an effort to make the company more profitable. Sony's AIBO customer support was withdrawn gradually, with support for the final ERS-7M3 ending in March 2013.\n",
            "paragraph3": "In July 2014, Sony stopped providing repairs for AIBO products and did not provide customer support or repair for the older AIBO robots.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In November 2017, Sony announced a new generation of AIBO after 11 years. The fourth generation model, ERS-1000, was launched in Japan on 11 January 2018. The second lottery sale was set on 6 February 2018.\n"

            "paragraph1": "AIBO grew out of Sony's Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). Founded in 1990, CSL was set up to emulate the innovation center at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). CSL's first product was the Aperios operating system, later to form the base software some AIBO models used. When Nobuyuki Idei became president of Sony in 1995, he sought to adopt a digital agenda, reflected in the new motto he gave the company, “Digital Dream Kids,” and the prominence he gave to CSL.\n",

            "paragraph2": "Dr. Toshitada Doi is credited as AIBO's original progenitor: in 1994 he had started work on robots with artificial intelligence expert Masahiro Fujita within CSL. Fujita would write that the robot's behaviors will need to “be sufficiently complex or unexpected so that people keep an interest in watching or taking care of it”. Fujita argued that entertainment robots might be viable as \"A robot for entertainment can be effectively designed using various state-of-the-art technologies, such as speech recognition and vision, even though these technologies may not be mature enough for applications where they perform a critical function. While there exist special and difficult requirements in entertainment applications themselves, limited capabilities in the speech and vision systems may turn out to be an interesting and attractive feature for appropriately designed entertainment robots.\" His early monkey-like prototype \"MUTANT\" included behaviors that would become part of AIBOs including tracking a yellow ball, shaking hands, karate strikes and sleeping. Fujita would later receive the IEEE Inaba Technical Award for Innovation Leading to Production for \"AIBO, the world's first mass-market consumer robot for entertainment applications\".\n",
            "paragraph3": "A friend of Doi's, the artist Hajime Sorayama, was enlisted to create the initial designs for the AIBO's body.  Those designs are now part of the permanent collections of Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution. The first generation AIBO design won Japan's prestigious \"Good Design Award, Grand Prize\" and a special Intelligent Design award in the 2000 German Red Dot awards.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In 1997 Doi received backing from Idei to form Sony's Digital Creatures Lab. Believing that robots would be commonplace in households by 2010, but aware of the shortcomings of available technology for functional uses, he decided to focus on robots for entertainment. The AIBO responded to over 100 voice commands and talked in a tonal language, or talked like a human and made other noises if programmed to. Two of the first generation AIBOs exported into the USA came to New York, NY and one remains in the archives and displays at Artspace Company Y LLC.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Later models of AIBOs were designed jointly with prestigious Japanese designers, and continued to gain design awards. The ERS-210 design was inspired by lion cubs. The bodies of the \"ERS-3x\" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist Katsura Moshino winning the \"Good Design Award\" The sleek and futuristic, space-exploration inspired body of the \"ERS-220\" was designed by Shoji Kawamori. winning the \"Good Design Award\" and a \"Design for Asia\" award. The ERS-7 Also won a \"Good Design Award\".\n",
            "paragraph6": "Almost ten years later, Idei's successor, Howard Stringer closed down AIBO and other robotic projects. Doi then staged a mock funeral, attended by more than 100 colleagues from Sony. At the funeral, Doi said that the Aibo was a symbol of a risk-taking spirit at Sony that was now dead.\n",

The specifications and design of the 1997 and 1998 prototypes, described in a Sony press release, closely match those of the first generation AIBOs. Differences include the use of PC-Cards for memory (rather than MemoryStick media), the use of two batteries, and the option to use a 2-wheeled \"rolling module\" in place of legs.\n",

            "paragraph2": "The first commercially available AIBO. It has a beagle-like appearance. Sales began on 1 June 1999. There was a limited production of 3,000 for Japan and 2,000 for the USA (5,000 total units that were manufactured).\nThey are often considered the rarest model. They were available to buy via the internet and sold out in 20 minutes after launch. It was silver with a golden-brown hue and grey claws.\nERS-110 cost 250,000 yen, or US$2,500, which would convert to over $3,500 as of 2020.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The ERS-111 was an improved version of the original AIBO, initially released in November 1999. 40,000 units in total. Same price as ERS-110.\nIt looks similar to ERS-110, but with different ear/tail shapes and different capabilities. It was available in shiny silver with black claws or metallic black color.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Second generation models (2x0, 31x)",
            "paragraph4": "The ERS-210 was designed to look like a lion cub but is really a dog with a flat bull terrier face and jack-Russel appearance. It has speech recognition capabilities. The colors were black, silver, gold, red, blue, green, white.\nIt is the most common and most popular AIBO model and sold well over 65,000 units. It cost around $1,500 at launch and eventually went down to less than $1,000.\n",

            "paragraph7": "The ERS-31x models had an \"AIBO's heart\" slogan. The original production design illustrator was Katsura Moschino. The price was 98,000 YEN, OR US$950.\nThe \"Latte\" (ERS-311) is an off-white/cream color and is considered the \"friendly\" model. The \"Macaron\" (ERS-312) is mostly black with cream accents and is considered the \"naughty\" model. \nThe \"Pug\" (ERS-31L) is the least common of the three and was $200 cheaper. The 31x series dogs are considered to look like a Bichon puppy or a bear cub.\n",
            "paragraph8": "These models are aesthetically identical to their 31x predecessors but have an added Bluetooth capability chip installed to enable communication with the \"Handy viewer.\" The Handy Viewer was an exclusive Japanese device that would translate Aibos thoughts and feelings into text, and enable the handler to play games with them. While the ERS-311 and ERS-312 received these new releases, the ERS-31L never received the Bluetooth update to their hardware.\n",

Priced at between $1500 to $2000. It was once a common misconception that ERS-7 only sold 15,000 units, but the serial numbers of the dogs prove this to be false, plus, ERS-7s are pretty common to find so would also prove this theory to be wrong. Instead, it is estimated that ERS-7 sold 15,000 units of each variant, so that would mean there are in total: 15,000 M1s, 15,000 M2s and 15,000 M3s (which means in every unit of all variants, 45,000 units were manufactured).\n",

Requires an always-on internet connection to function fully and comes with an LTE SIM card and monthly subscription service to support interaction and learning in the cloud. This model of Aibo has a much cuter appearance than most of the other models. The ERS-1000 can recognize up to 100 faces, and can memorize a customizable trick, and responds to over 50 voice commands.\nIt costs around $3,000.\n",

Aperios OS was intended to be widely deployed using revolutionary real-time capabilities to handle multiple audio and visual data streams concurrently The operating system was not widely adopted, and by 2003 Sony had stopped active development with COO Kunitake Ando commenting \"Aperios was an operating system of a pre-Internet age and we decided that it isn't adequate for the future\".\n",
            "paragraph3": "The OPEN-R architecture is specific to entertainment robots. The architecture involves the use of modular hardware components, such as appendages that can be easily removed and replaced to change the shape and function of the robots, and modular software components that can be interchanged to change their behavior and movement patterns. AIBO's creator, Doi, called OPEN-R the masterpiece of the AIBO development project, arguing it would minimize the need for programming individual movements or responses, and its \"open\" nature would encourage a global community of robot specialists and programmers to add capability.\n",
