            "paragraph1": "Biocybernetics is the application of cybernetics to biological science disciplines such as neurology and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in systems biology, seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function. The field of cybernetics itself has origins in biological disciplines such as neurophysiology.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of theoretical biology, based upon the principles of systemics.\n"

Although the extended form of the word is biological cybernetics, the field is most commonly referred to as biocybernetics in scientific papers. Bioinformatics may also be properly referred to as bio informatics.\n"

Such fields involve disciplines that specify certain aspects of the study of the living organism (for example, neurocybernetics focuses on the study neurological models in organisms).\n"
