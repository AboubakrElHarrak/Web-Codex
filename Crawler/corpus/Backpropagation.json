            "paragraph1": "In machine learning, backpropagation (backprop, BP) is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. Generalizations of backpropagation exist for other artificial neural networks (ANNs), and for functions generally. These classes of algorithms are all referred to generically as \"backpropagation\". In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually. This efficiency makes it feasible to use gradient methods for training multilayer networks, updating weights to minimize loss; gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this is an example of dynamic programming.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The term backpropagation strictly refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; however, the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm, including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent. Backpropagation generalizes the gradient computation in the delta rule, which is the single-layer version of backpropagation, and is in turn generalized by automatic differentiation, where backpropagation is a special case of reverse accumulation (or \"reverse mode\"). The term backpropagation and its general use in neural networks was announced in Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams (1986a), then elaborated and popularized in Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams (1986b), but the technique was independently rediscovered many times, and had many predecessors dating to the 1960s; see § History. A modern overview is given in the deep learning textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016).\n"

They used principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Stuart Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic system optimization method in 1969. Backpropagation was derived by multiple researchers in the early 60's and implemented to run on computers as early as 1970 by Seppo Linnainmaa. Paul Werbos was first in the US to propose that it could be used for neural nets after analyzing it in depth in his 1974 dissertation. While not applied to neural networks, in 1970 Linnainmaa published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD). Although very controversial, some scientists believe this was actually the first step toward developing a back-propagation algorithm. In 1973 Dreyfus adapts parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974 Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to artificial neural networks, and in 1982 he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to non-linear functions.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Later the Werbos method was rediscovered and described in 1985 by Parker, and in 1986 by Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams. Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams showed experimentally that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks. Yann LeCun proposed the modern form of the back-propagation learning algorithm for neural networks in his PhD thesis in 1987. In 1993, Eric Wan won an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation.\n",
            "paragraph4": "During the 2000s it fell out of favour, but returned in the 2010s, benefitting from cheap, powerful GPU-based computing systems. This has been especially so in speech recognition, machine vision, natural language processing, and language structure learning research (in which it has been used to explain a variety of phenomena related to first and second language learning.).\n",
