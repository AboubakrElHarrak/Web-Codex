            "paragraph1": "In mathematics, fuzzy sets (a.k.a. uncertain sets) are sets whose elements have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by Lotfi A. Zadeh and Dieter Klaua  in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.\nAt the same time, Salii (1965) defined a more general kind of structure called an L-relation, which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are now used throughout fuzzy mathematics and have applications in areas such as linguistics (De Cock, Bodenhofer & Kerre 2000), decision-making (Kuzmin 1982), and clustering (Bezdek 1978), are special cases of L-relations when L is the unit interval [0, 1].\n",
            "paragraph2": "In classical set theory, the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition—an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the indicator functions (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called crisp sets. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as bioinformatics.\n"

            "paragraph48": "Neutrosophic fuzzy sets were introduced by Smarandache in 1998. Like IFS, neutrosophic fuzzy sets have the previous two functions: one for membership \n\n\n\n\nμ\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{A}(x)}\n\n and another for non-membership \n\n\n\n\nν\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nu _{A}(x)}\n\n. The major difference is that neutrosophic fuzzy sets have one more function: for indeterminate \n\n\n\n\ni\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i_{A}(x)}\n\n. This value indicates that the degree of undecidedness that the entity x belongs to the set. This concept of having indeterminate \n\n\n\n\ni\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i_{A}(x)}\n\n value can be particularly useful when one cannot be very confident on the membership or non-membership values for item x. In summary, neutrosophic fuzzy sets are associated with the following functions:\n",
            "subtitle9": "Pythagorean fuzzy sets",
            "paragraph49": "The other extension of IFS is what is known as Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Pythagorean fuzzy sets are more flexible than IFSs. IFSs are based on the constraint \n\n\n\n\nμ\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n+\n\nν\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n≤\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{A}(x)+\\nu _{A}(x)\\leq 1}\n\n, which can be considered as too restrictive in some occasions. This is why Yager proposed the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Such sets satisfy the constraint \n\n\n\n\nμ\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nν\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n≤\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{A}(x)^{2}+\\nu _{A}(x)^{2}\\leq 1}\n\n, which is reminiscent of the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagorean fuzzy sets can be applicable to real life applications in which the previous condition of \n\n\n\n\nμ\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n+\n\nν\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n≤\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{A}(x)+\\nu _{A}(x)\\leq 1}\n\n is not valid. However, the less restrictive condition of \n\n\n\n\nμ\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nν\n\nA\n\n\n(\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n≤\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{A}(x)^{2}+\\nu _{A}(x)^{2}\\leq 1}\n\n may be suitable in more domains.\n"
