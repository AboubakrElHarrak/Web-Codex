            "paragraph1": "Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages (\"mail\") between people using electronic devices. Email was thus conceived as the electronic (digital) version of, or counterpart to, mail, at a time when \"mail\" meant only physical mail (hence e- + mail). Email later became a ubiquitous (very widely used) communication medium, to the point that in current use, an e-mail address is often treated as a basic and necessary part of many processes in business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and other spheres of daily life in most countries. Email is the medium, and each message sent therewith is called an email (mass/count distinction).\n",
            "paragraph2": "Email's earliest development began in the 1960s, but at first users could send e-mail only to other users of the same computer. Some systems also supported a form of instant messaging, where sender and receiver needed to be online simultaneously. The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early ARPANET, with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s is similar to a basic email sent today.  Ray Tomlinson is credited as the inventor of networked email; in 1971, he developed the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link the user name with a destination server. By the mid-1970s, this was the form recognized as email. At the time, though, email, like most computing, was mostly just for \"computer geeks\" in certain environments, such as engineering and the sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, use of email became common in the worlds of business management, government, universities, and defense/military industries, but much of the public did not use it yet. Starting with the advent of web browsers in the mid-1990s, use of email began to extend to the rest of the public, no longer something only for geeks in certain professions or industries. By the 2010s, webmail (the web-era form of email) had gained its ubiquitous status. \n",
            "paragraph3": "Email operates across computer networks, primarily the Internet. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Originally an ASCII text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments. International email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, is standardized but not widely adopted.\n"

            "paragraph2": "Historically, the term electronic mail is any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to refer to fax document transmission. As a result, finding its first use is difficult with the specific meaning it has today.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The term electronic mail has been in use with its current meaning since at least 1975, and variations of the shorter E-mail have been in use since at least 1979:\n",

Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the ARPANET (created in the late 1960s), which aimed at software portability between its systems.  In 1971 the first ARPANET network email was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) protocol was introduced in 1981.\n",
            "paragraph2": "For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X.400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate.[nb 1] However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard.\n"

The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a domain name. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System (DNS).\n3 - The DNS server for the domain b.org (ns.b.org) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case mx.b.org, a message transfer agent (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.[27]\n4 - smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent (MDA).\n5 - The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob.\n6 - Bob's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol (POP3) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).\n",

            "ul1": "Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\nAlice may not have an MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service.\nAlice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1.\nBob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\nDomains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called open mail relays. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable.  However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare, and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.\n"

The extensions in International email apply only to email. RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008, then RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 – the standard for Internet email for decades. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Internet email messages consist of two sections, 'header' and 'body'. These are known as 'content'.  The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a signature block at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Message header",
            "paragraph3": "RFC 5322 specifies the syntax of the email header. Each email message has a header (the \"header section\" of the message, according to the specification), comprising a number of fields (\"header fields\"). Each field has a name (\"field name\" or \"header field name\"), followed by the separator character \":\", and a value (\"field body\" or \"header field body\").\n",
            "paragraph4": "Each field name begins in the first character of a new line in the header section, and begins with a non-whitespace printable character. It ends with the separator character \":\". The separator is followed by the field value (the \"field body\"). The value can continue onto subsequent lines if those lines have space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without SMTPUTF8, field bodies are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Email header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the limit is 998 characters. Header fields defined by RFC 5322 contain only US-ASCII characters; for encoding characters in other sets, a syntax specified in RFC 2047 may be used. In some examples, the IETF EAI working group defines some standards track extensions, replacing previous experimental extensions so UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters may be used within the header. In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products, and promoted by some government agents.\n",
            "paragraph6": "The message header must include at least the following fields:\n",
            "ul1": "From: The email address, and, optionally, the name of the author(s). Some email clients are changeable through account settings.\nDate: The local time and date the message was written. Like the From: field, many email clients fill this in automatically before sending. The recipient's client may display the time in the format and time zone local to them.\n",
            "paragraph7": "RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA; it provides for permanent and provisional field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:\n",

Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.\nSubject: A brief summary of the topic of the message. Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject, including \"RE:\" and \"FW:\".\nCc: Carbon copy; Many email clients mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list.\nBcc: Blind carbon copy; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.\nContent-Type: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a MIME type.\nPrecedence: commonly with values \"bulk\", \"junk\", or \"list\"; used to indicate automated \"vacation\" or \"out of office\" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with \"Precedence: special-delivery\" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it was. Microsoft Exchange respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the X-Auto-Response-Suppress field.[43]\nMessage-ID: Also an automatic-generated field to prevent multiple deliveries and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).\nIn-Reply-To: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies to reply messages.\nReferences: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.\nReply-To: Address should be used to reply to the message.\nSender: Address of the sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).\nArchived-At: A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.\n",
            "paragraph8": "The To: field may be unrelated to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, SMTP, which may be extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages relayed. Data pertaining to the server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\n",

            "paragraph11": "Internet email was designed for 7-bit ASCII. Most email software is 8-bit clean, but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: quoted printable for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data. The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many mail transport agents may not support them. In some countries, e-mail software violates RFC 5322 by sending raw[nb 2] non-ASCII text and several encoding schemes co-exist; as a result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international character sets, Unicode is growing in popularity.[citation needed]\n",
            "paragraph12": "Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user. HTML email messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in block quotes, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as underlines and italics, and change font styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about web bugs, abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software.\n",

As of 2011, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Individuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone. It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on a smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.\n",
            "paragraph7": "As of 2010, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media. Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR, vinyl records and film cameras—no longer cool and something older people do.\n",
            "paragraph8": "A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.\n"

            "title": "Issues",
            "subtitle1": "Attachment size limitation",
            "paragraph1": "Email messages may have one or more attachments, which are additional files that are appended to the email. Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents, PDF documents, and scanned images of paper documents. In principle, there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments. However, in practice, email clients, servers, and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email - typically to 25MB or less. Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ from what the user sees, which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email. Where larger files need to be shared, various file hosting services are available and commonly used.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Information overload",
            "paragraph2": "The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and \"white collar\" employees has led to concerns that recipients face an \"information overload\" in dealing with increasing volumes of email. With the growth in mobile devices, by default employees may also receive work-related emails outside of their working day. This can lead to increased stress and decreased satisfaction with work. Some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect, as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Spam",
            "paragraph3": "Email \"spam\" is unsolicited bulk email. The low cost of sending such email meant that, by 2003, up to 30% of total email traffic was spam, and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool. The US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact, and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users, but the volume sent is still very high—and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links. In September 2017, for example, the proportion of spam to legitimate email rose to 59.56%. The percentage of spam email in 2021 is estimated to be 85%.[better source needed]\n",
            "subtitle4": "Malware",
            "paragraph4": "A range of malicious email types exist. These range from various types of email scams, including \"social engineering\" scams such as advance-fee scam \"Nigerian letters\", to phishing, email bombardment and email worms.\n",
            "subtitle5": "Email spoofing",
            "paragraph5": "Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n",
            "subtitle6": "Email bombing",
            "paragraph6": "Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n",
            "subtitle7": "Privacy concerns",
            "paragraph7": "Today it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\n",
            "paragraph8": "Email privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n",
            "ul1": "email messages are generally not encrypted.\nemail messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\nmany Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\nthe \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\nweb bugs invisibly embedded in HTML content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is rendered as HTML (some e-mail clients do this when the user reads, or re-reads the e-mail) and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the user agent string.\n",
            "paragraph9": "There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP, SMEmail, or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\n",
            "paragraph10": "Additionally, many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer-to-peer filesharing. Attached files may contain trojans or viruses.\n",
            "subtitle8": "Legal contracts",
            "paragraph11": "It is possible for an exchange of emails to form a binding contract, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence. A signature block on an email may be interpreted as satisfying a signature requirement for a contract.\n",
            "subtitle9": "Flaming",
            "paragraph12": "Flaming occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word incendiary to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.\n",
            "subtitle10": "Email bankruptcy",
            "paragraph13": "Also known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.\n",
            "subtitle11": "Internationalization",
            "paragraph14": "Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based. MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets, but other headers and email addresses using UTF-8, while standardized have yet to be widely adopted.\n",
            "subtitle12": "Tracking of sent mail",
            "paragraph15": "The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications (delivery receipts) and Message Disposition Notifications (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production.[nb 3]\n",
            "paragraph16": "Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n",
            "ul2": "Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\nIf the spammer uses a forged sender email address (email spoofing), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.\n",
            "paragraph17": "In the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns, and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML. Many mail clients now default to not showing \"web content\". Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images.\n"
