Published in 1954, Qian's published work \"Engineering Cybernetics\" describes the mathematical and engineering concepts of cybernetic ideas as understood at the time, breaking them down into granular scientific concepts for application. Qian's work is notable for going beyond model-based theories and arguing for the necessity of a new design principle for types of system the properties\nand characteristics of which are largely unknown.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In the 2020s, concerns with the social consequences of cyber-physical systems, have led to calls to develop \"a new branch of engineering\", \"drawing on the history of cybernetics and reimagining it for our 21st century challenges\".\n"

Referred to as a CAM (cybernetic anthropomorphous machine), this machine was designed for use by the US Army ground troops. Operated by one man in a \"cockpit\" at the front end, the machine's \"legs\" steps were duplicates of the leg movements of the harnessed operator.\n"
