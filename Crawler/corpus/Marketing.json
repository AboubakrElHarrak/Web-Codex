            "paragraph1": "Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\n",
            "paragraph2": "It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product's target market. Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.\n",
            "paragraph4": "The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants.\n"

            "title": "Definition",
            "paragraph1": "Marketing is currently defined by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\". However, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. The AMA reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years. The interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008. The development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the AMA's 1935 version: \"Marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\". The newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Recent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. For instance, prolific marketing author and educator, Philip Kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. In 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\", and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\". A related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".\n",
            "paragraph3": "Besides, customers some definitions of marketing highlight marketing's ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. In this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\". For instance, the Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".\n",
            "paragraph4": "In the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts. However, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science. Marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.\n"

            "title": "Concept",
            "paragraph1": "The \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later. Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Given the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:\n",
            "paragraph3": "Marketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer's unmet needs. Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\" Needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \"places the customers' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\" Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market. In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product's benefits meet the customer's needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.\n"

            "paragraph2": "B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Examples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n",

            "paragraph4": "The four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n",
            "ul2": "Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\nResellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\nGovernments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\nInstitutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)[4]\n",
            "subtitle2": "B2C marketing",
            "paragraph5": "Business-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Traditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.\n",
            "subtitle3": "C2B marketing",
            "paragraph7": "Consumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n",
            "subtitle4": "C2C marketing",
            "paragraph8": "Customer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.\n",
            "subtitle5": "Differences in B2B and B2C marketing",
            "paragraph9": "The different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.\n",
            "ul3": "Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.[4]\nPurchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.[4]\nNumber of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.[4]\nCustomer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.[4]\nDistribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.[4]\nBuying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.[4]\nBuying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.[4]\nNegotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.[4]\nReciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.[4]\nLeasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.[4]\nPromotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.[4]\n"

            "paragraph1": "A marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\" or \"a corporate state of mind\" or as an \"organisation culture\" Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:\n",
            "ul1": "Product concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. It has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.[37][38]\nProduction concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. It dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"[39]\nSelling concept: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques,[40] largely for \"unsought goods\"[41] in industrial companies.[42] A 2011 meta analyses[43] found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson's sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role).\n",
            "ul2": "Marketing concept: This is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. These firm engage in extensive market research, use R&D (Research & Development), and then utilize promotion techniques.[44][45] The marketing orientation includes:\nCustomer orientation: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm's future viability and even existence as a going concern.\nOrganizational orientation: The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. A marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires. The production department would then start to manufacture the product. The finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\nCustomer orientation: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy.

            "paragraph3": "One of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis on an inside-out view. An inside-out approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organization's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders. In contrast, an outside-in approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.\n",
            "paragraph4": "From a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either promotion or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element. Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Other important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.\n",
            "paragraph6": "To overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n",

These people form part of the overall service experience.\nProcess- the way in which orders are handled, customers are satisfied and the service is delivered[55]\nPhysical Evidence- the tangible examples of marketing that the customer has encountered before buying the advertised product\nProductivity- the ability to provide consumers with quality product using as few resources as possible[56]\n",

            "paragraph12": "Cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.\n",
            "paragraph13": "Convenience\n",
            "paragraph14": "Like \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.\n",

            "subtitle1": "Outline of The Marketing Plan",
            "paragraph2": "Within the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n",
            "ul1": "Executive Summary\nCurrent marketing situation\nThreats and opportunities analysis\nObjectives and issues\nMarketing Strategy\nAction programs\nBudgets\nControl\n",
            "subtitle2": "Levels of marketing objectives within an organization",
            "paragraph3": "As stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n",
            "paragraph4": "At the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a conglomerate), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n",
            "paragraph5": "A strategic business unit (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n",
            "paragraph6": "The functional level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n"

            "paragraph3": "During the growth stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n",
            "paragraph4": "When the product hits maturity, its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n",
            "paragraph5": "During decline, demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued.\n"
