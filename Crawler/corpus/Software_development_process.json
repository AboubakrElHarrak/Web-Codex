It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC).  The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.\n",

The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle.\n"

According to Elliott (2004) the systems development life cycle (SDLC) can be considered to be the oldest formalized methodology framework for building information systems. The main idea of the SDLC has been \"to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle––from the inception of the idea to delivery of the final system––to be carried out rigidly and sequentially\" within the context of the framework being applied. The main target of this methodology framework in the 1960s was \"to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines\".\n",
            "paragraph2": "Methodologies, processes, and frameworks range from specific proscriptive steps that can be used directly by an organization in day-to-day work, to flexible frameworks that an organization uses to generate a custom set of steps tailored to the needs of a specific project or group.  In some cases, a \"sponsor\" or \"maintenance\" organization distributes an official set of documents that describe the process.  Specific examples include:\n",

            "paragraph7": "Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology, which favors iterative development and the rapid construction of prototypes instead of large amounts of up-front planning. The \"planning\" of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.\n",
            "paragraph8": "The rapid development process starts with the development of preliminary data models and business process models using structured techniques. In the next stage, requirements are verified using prototyping, eventually to refine the data and process models. These stages are repeated iteratively; further development results in \"a combined business requirements and technical design statement to be used for constructing new systems\".\n",
            "paragraph9": "The term was first used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1991.  According to Whitten (2003), it is a merger of various structured techniques, especially data-driven information technology engineering, with prototyping techniques to accelerate software systems development.\n",

These tools may include Graphical User Interface (GUI) builders, Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, Database Management Systems (DBMS), fourth-generation programming languages, code generators, and object-oriented techniques.\nKey emphasis is on fulfilling the business need, while technological or engineering excellence is of lesser importance.\nProject control involves prioritizing development and defining delivery deadlines or “timeboxes”. If the project starts to slip, emphasis is on reducing requirements to fit the timebox, not in increasing the deadline.\nGenerally includes joint application design (JAD), where users are intensely involved in system design, via consensus building in either structured workshops, or electronically facilitated interaction.\nActive user involvement is imperative.\nIteratively produces production software, as opposed to a throwaway prototype.\nProduces documentation necessary to facilitate future development and maintenance.\nStandard systems analysis and design methods can be fitted into this framework.\n",

Written documentation is an explicit deliverable of each phase.\n",

A strict waterfall approach discourages revisiting and revising any prior phase once it is complete.[according to whom?] This \"inflexibility\" in a pure waterfall model has been a source of criticism by supporters of other more \"flexible\" models.  It has been widely blamed for several large-scale government projects running over budget, over time and sometimes failing to deliver on requirements due to the Big Design Up Front approach.[according to whom?] Except when contractually required, the waterfall model has been largely superseded by more flexible and versatile methodologies developed specifically for software development.[according to whom?] See Criticism of Waterfall model.\n",
