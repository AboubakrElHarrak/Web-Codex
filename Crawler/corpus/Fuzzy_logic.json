It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.\n",

Fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.\n",

However, there are also propositions with variable answers, such as one might find when asking a group of people to identify a color.  In such instances, the truth appears as the result of reasoning from inexact or partial knowledge in which the sampled answers are mapped on a spectrum.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Both degrees of truth and probabilities range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first, but fuzzy logic uses degrees of truth as a mathematical model of vagueness, while probability is a mathematical model of ignorance.\n",

            "paragraph3": "A basic application might characterize various sub-ranges of a continuous variable.  For instance, a temperature measurement for anti-lock brakes might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled. Fuzzy set theory provides a means for representing uncertainty.\n",

Because natural languages do not always contain enough value terms to express a fuzzy value scale, it is common practice to modify linguistic values with adjectives or adverbs.  For example, we can use the hedges rather and somewhat to construct the additional values rather old or somewhat young.\n\n"

            "paragraph2": "Fuzzification is the process of assigning the numerical input of a system to fuzzy sets with some degree of membership. This degree of membership may be anywhere within the interval [0,1]. If it is 0 then the value does not belong to the given fuzzy set, and if it is 1 then the value completely belongs within the fuzzy set. Any value between 0 and 1 represents the degree of uncertainty that the value belongs in the set. These fuzzy sets are typically described by words, and so by assigning the system input to fuzzy sets, we can reason with it in a linguistically natural manner.\n",
            "paragraph3": "For example, in the image below the meanings of the expressions cold, warm, and hot are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three \"truth values\"—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as \"not hot\"; i.e. this temperature has zero membership in the fuzzy set \"hot\". The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as \"slightly warm\" and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) \"fairly cold\". Therefore, this temperature has 0.2 membership in the fuzzy set \"warm\" and 0.8 membership in the fuzzy set \"cold\". The degree of membership assigned for each fuzzy set is the result of fuzzification.\n",

These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule.

A neural network will take a variety of valued inputs, give them different weights in relation to each other, and arrive at a decision which normally also has a value. Nowhere in that process is there anything like the sequences of either-or decisions which characterise non-fuzzy mathematics, almost all of computer programming, and digital electronics. The 1980s witnessed a debate about what AI would eventually look like - some researchers tried to model 'common sense' with huge bivalent decision trees, while others used neural networks, which soon found their way into a multitude of electronic devices. Obviously the underlying logic of the latter approach is radically different to the former, even if neural networks are built on top of bivalent electronics. Fuzzy logic gives AI a more accurate way to model complex situations. \n",

            "paragraph4": "Fuzzy logic is an important concept when it comes to medical decision making.  Since medical and healthcare data can be subjective or fuzzy, applications in this domain have a great potential to benefit a lot by using fuzzy logic based approaches.  One of the common application areas that use fuzzy logic is computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine. CAD is a computerized set of inter-related tools that can be used to aid physicians in their diagnostic decision-making. For example, when a physician finds a lesion that is abnormal but still at a very early stage of development he/she may use a CAD approach to characterize the lesion and diagnose its nature. Fuzzy logic can be highly appropriate to describe key characteristics of this lesion. Fuzzy logic can be used in many different aspects within the CAD framework. Such aspects include in medical image analysis, biomedical signal analysis, segmentation of images or signals, and feature extraction / selection of images or signals as described, for instance, in  and.\n",
            "paragraph5": "The biggest question in this application area is how much useful information can be derived when using fuzzy logic. A major challenge is how to derive the required fuzzy data.  This is even more challenging when one has to elicit such data from humans (usually, patients).  As it said \"The envelope of what can be achieved and what cannot be achieved in medical diagnosis, ironically, is itself a fuzzy one\" [Seven Challenges, 2019].  How to elicit fuzzy data, and how to validate the accuracy of the data is still an ongoing effort strongly related to the application of fuzzy logic. The problem of assessing the quality of fuzzy data is a difficult one.  This is why fuzzy logic is a highly promising possibility within the CAD application area but still requires more research to achieve its full potential. Although the concepts of using fuzzy logic in CAD is exciting, there are still several challenges that fuzzy approaches face within the CAD framework.\n"

Its models correspond to BL-algebras.\nŁukasiewicz fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras.\nGödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is the Gödel t-norm (that is, minimum).

It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras.\nFuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka's logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ syntax is also evaluated. This means that each formula has an evaluation.

Thus the question of a suitable extension of them to fuzzy set theory is a crucial one. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of fuzzy Turing machine, Markov normal fuzzy algorithm and fuzzy program (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in  one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not  adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine.  Then they proposed the following definitions. Denote by Ü  the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset s : S \n\n\n\n→\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n\n[0,1] of a set S is recursively enumerable if a recursive map h : S×N \n\n\n\n→\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n\nÜ exists such that, for every x in S, the function h(x,n) is increasing with respect to n and s(x) = lim h(x,n).\nWe say that s is decidable if both s and its complement –s are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).\nThe proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).\n",

In particular, the fuzzy set of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.\n",

Like fuzzy logic, they are methods used to overcome continuous variables or systems too complex to completely enumerate or understand discretely or exactly. Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and feed forward, basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.\n"
