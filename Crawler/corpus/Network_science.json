The field draws on theories and methods including graph theory from mathematics, statistical mechanics from physics, data mining and information visualization from computer science, inferential modeling from statistics, and social structure from sociology. The United States National Research Council defines network science as \"the study of network representations of physical, biological, and social phenomena leading to predictive models of these phenomena.\"\n"

            "paragraph1": "The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of analyzing complex relational data. The earliest known paper in this field is the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg written by Leonhard Euler in 1736. Euler's mathematical description of vertices and edges was the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of pairwise relations in a network structure. The field of graph theory continued to develop and found applications in chemistry (Sylvester, 1878).\n",

            "paragraph3": "In the 1930s Jacob Moreno, a psychologist in the Gestalt tradition, arrived in the United States. He developed the sociogram and presented it to the public in April 1933 at a convention of medical scholars. Moreno claimed that \"before the advent of sociometry no one knew what the interpersonal structure of a group 'precisely' looked like\" (Moreno, 1953). The sociogram was a representation of the social structure of a group of elementary school students. The boys were friends of boys and the girls were friends of girls with the exception of one boy who said he liked a single girl. The feeling was not reciprocated. This network representation of social structure was found so intriguing that it was printed in The New York Times (April 3, 1933, page 17). The sociogram has found many applications and has grown into the field of social network analysis.\n",
            "paragraph4": "Probabilistic theory in network science developed as an offshoot of graph theory with Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi's eight famous papers on random graphs. For social networks the exponential random graph model or p* is a notational framework used to represent the probability space of a tie occurring in a social network. An alternate approach to network probability structures is the network probability matrix, which models the probability of edges occurring in a network, based on the historic presence or absence of the edge in a sample of networks.\n",
            "paragraph5": "In 1998, David Krackhardt and Kathleen Carley introduced the idea of a meta-network with the PCANS Model. They suggest that \"all organizations are structured along these three domains, Individuals, Tasks, and Resources\". Their paper introduced the concept that networks occur across multiple domains and that they are interrelated. This field has grown into another sub-discipline of network science called dynamic network analysis.\n",
            "paragraph6": "More recently other network science efforts have focused on mathematically describing different network topologies. Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz reconciled empirical data on networks with mathematical representation, describing the small-world network. Albert-László Barabási and Reka Albert developed the scale-free network which is a loosely defined network topology that contains hub vertices with many connections, that grow in a way to maintain a constant ratio in the number of the connections versus all other nodes. In the context of citation networks, the scale-free network model is an undirected version of the earlier directed Price model. There is significant disagreement within the scientific community as to whether real world networks are scale-free or not, with some arguing that they are ubiquitous, and others arguing that they are rare. Many in the network science community argue that knowledge of whether the degree distribution is fat tailed or not is more important than knowing whether the distribution fits the stricter criteria of being scale-free.\n",

Parmentola, the U.S. Army Director for Research and Laboratory Management, proposed to the Army's Board on Science and Technology (BAST) on December 1, 2003 that Network Science become a new Army research area.  The BAST, the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences for the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies, serves as a convening authority for the discussion of science and technology issues of importance to the Army and oversees independent Army-related studies conducted by the National Academies.  The BAST conducted a study to find out whether identifying and funding a new field of investigation in basic research, Network Science, could help close the gap between what is needed to realize Network-Centric Operations and the current primitive state of fundamental knowledge of networks.\n",

Based on the findings and recommendations of that study and the subsequent 2007 NRC report titled Strategy for an Army Center for Network Science, Technology, and Experimentation, Army basic research resources were redirected to initiate a new basic research program in Network Science.

McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments, susceptible: \n\n\n\nS\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(t)}\n\n, infected, \n\n\n\nI\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I(t)}\n\n, and recovered, \n\n\n\nR\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R(t)}\n\n. The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:\n",
            "ul1": "\n\n\n\nS\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(t)}\n\n is used to represent the number of individuals not yet infected with the disease at time t, or those susceptible to the disease\n\n\n\n\nI\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I(t)}\n\n denotes the number of individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category\n\n\n\n\nR\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R(t)}\n\n is the compartment used for those individuals who have been infected and then recovered from the disease.  Those in this category are not able to be infected again or to transmit the infection to others.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The flow of this model may be considered as follows:\n",
            "paragraph4": "Using a fixed population, \n\n\n\nN\n=\nS\n(\nt\n)\n+\nI\n(\nt\n)\n+\nR\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N=S(t)+I(t)+R(t)}\n\n, Kermack and McKendrick derived the following equations:\n",
            "paragraph5": "Several assumptions were made in the formulation of these equations: First, an individual in the population must be considered as having an equal probability as every other individual of contracting the disease with a rate of \n\n\n\nβ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta }\n\n, which is considered the contact or infection rate of the disease.  Therefore, an infected individual makes contact and is able to transmit the disease with \n\n\n\nβ\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta N}\n\n others per unit time and the fraction of contacts by an infected with a susceptible is \n\n\n\nS\n\n/\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S/N}\n\n.  The number of new infections in unit time per infective then is \n\n\n\nβ\nN\n(\nS\n\n/\n\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta N(S/N)}\n\n, giving the rate of new infections (or those leaving the susceptible category) as \n\n\n\nβ\nN\n(\nS\n\n/\n\nN\n)\nI\n=\nβ\nS\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta N(S/N)I=\\beta SI}\n\n (Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2001).  For the second and third equations, consider the population leaving the susceptible class as equal to the number entering the infected class.  However, infectives are leaving this class per unit time to enter the recovered/removed class at a rate \n\n\n\nγ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n\n per unit time (where \n\n\n\nγ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n\n represents the mean recovery rate, or \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nγ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/\\gamma }\n\n  the mean infective period). These processes which occur simultaneously are referred to as the Law of Mass Action, a widely accepted idea that the rate of contact between two groups in a population is proportional to the size of each of the groups concerned (Daley & Gani, 2005).  Finally, it is assumed that the rate of infection and recovery is much faster than the time scale of births and deaths and therefore, these factors are ignored in this model.\n",
            "paragraph6": "More can be read on this model on the Epidemic model page.\n",
            "subtitle2": "The master equation approach",
            "paragraph7": "A master equation can express the behaviour of an undirected growing network where, at each time step, a new node is added to the network, linked to an old node  (randomly chosen and without preference). The initial network is formed by two nodes and two links between them at time \n\n\n\nt\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=2}\n\n, this configuration is necessary only to simplify further calculations, so at time \n\n\n\nt\n=\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=n}\n\n the network have \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n nodes and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n links.\n",
            "paragraph8": "The master equation for this network is:\n",
            "paragraph9": "where \n\n\n\np\n(\nk\n,\ns\n,\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p(k,s,t)}\n\n is the probability to have the node \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n with degree \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n at time \n\n\n\nt\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t+1}\n\n, and \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n is the time step when this node was added to the network. Note that there are only two ways for an old node \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n to have \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n links at time \n\n\n\nt\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t+1}\n\n:\n",

            "paragraph10": "After simplifying this model, the degree distribution is \n\n\n\nP\n(\nk\n)\n=\n\n2\n\n−\nk\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(k)=2^{-k}.}\n\n\n",
            "paragraph11": "Based on this growing network, an epidemic model is developed following a simple rule: Each time the new node is added and after choosing the old node to link, a decision is made: whether or not this new node will be infected. The master equation for this epidemic model is:\n",
            "paragraph12": "where \n\n\n\n\nr\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{t))\n\n represents the decision to infect (\n\n\n\n\nr\n\nt\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{t}=1}\n\n) or not (\n\n\n\n\nr\n\nt\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{t}=0}\n\n). Solving this master equation, the following solution is obtained: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n~\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\nk\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tilde {P))_{r}(k)=\\left({\\frac {r}{2))\\right)^{k}.}\n\n\n"

            "title": "Interdependent networks",
            "paragraph1": "An interdependent network is a system of coupled networks where nodes of one or more networks depend on nodes in other networks. Such dependencies are enhanced by the developments in modern technology. Dependencies may lead to cascading failures between the networks and a relatively small failure can lead to a catastrophic breakdown of the system. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. A recent study developed a framework to study the cascading failures in an interdependent networks system using percolation theory.\n"
