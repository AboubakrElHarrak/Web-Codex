            "paragraph1": "Essential Systems Analysis was a new methodology for software specification published in 1984 by Stephen M. McMenamin and John F. Palmer for performing Structured Systems Analysis based on the concept of Event Partitioning.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The Essence of a system is \"its required behavior independent of the technology used to implement the system\". It is a model of what the system must do saying ideally nothing about how it will do it.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The methodology proposed that finding the true requirements for an information system entails the development of an Essential Model for the system, based on the concepts of a perfect internal technology, composed of:\n",
            "ul1": "a perfect memory, that is infinitely fast and big, and\na perfect processor, that is infinitely potent and fast.\n",
            "paragraph4": "It was later adapted by Edward Yourdon to develop Modern Structured Analysis.\n",
            "paragraph5": "The main result was a new and more systematic way to develop the Data Flow Diagrams, which are the most characteristic tool of Structured Analysis.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Essential Analysis, as adopted in YourdonÂ´s Modern Structured Analysis, was the main software development methodoly until Object Oriented Analysis became mainstream.\n"
