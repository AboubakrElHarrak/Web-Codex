A variant of Hebbian learning, competitive learning works by increasing the specialization of each node in the network.  It is well suited to finding clusters within data.\n",

The neuron that wins the competition is called a \"winner-take-all\" neuron.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Accordingly, the individual neurons of the network learn to specialize on ensembles of similar patterns and in so doing become 'feature detectors' for different classes of input patterns.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The fact that competitive networks recode sets of correlated inputs to one of a few output neurons essentially removes the redundancy in representation which is an essential part of processing in biological sensory systems.\n"
