It is the largest Wikipedia in a non-European language, as well as the largest for a language which is official in only one country. As of 2014, it has only 375,000 articles manually created, 67% of its articles having been made by bots, and thus ranks 3rd among non-European language Wikipedia after the Japanese and Chinese ones.\n"

The project received little attention and did not begin to receive significant contributions until it was \"restarted\" in October 2003 and the newer, Unicode-capable MediaWiki software was installed soon after.\n",

By the time the project reached the 100,000-article milestone on September 12, 2009, bot-generated articles made up around 5% of its corpus. Short articles are designated \"stubs\"; such articles number in the tens of thousands and include most of the bot-generated articles.\n",
