            "paragraph1": "The Internet Movie Database uses a formula for calculating and comparing the ratings of films by its users, including their Top Rated 250 Titles which is claimed to give \"a true Bayesian estimate\". The following Bayesian formula was initially used to calculate a weighted average score for the Top 250, though the formula has since changed:\n",
            "paragraph2": "where:\n",
            "paragraph3": "Note that W is just the weighted arithmetic mean of R and C with weight vector (v, m).  As the number of ratings surpasses m, the confidence of the average rating surpasses the confidence of the mean vote for all films (C), and the weighted bayesian rating (W) approaches a straight average (R). The closer v (the number of ratings for the film) is to zero, the closer W is to C, where W is the weighted rating and C is the average rating of all films. So, in simpler terms, the fewer ratings/votes cast for a film, the more that film's Weighted Rating will skew towards the average across all films, while films with many ratings/votes will have a rating approaching its pure arithmetic average rating.\n",
            "paragraph4": "IMDb's approach ensures that a film with only a few ratings, all at 10, would not rank above \"the Godfather\", for example, with a 9.2 average from over 500,000 ratings.\n"
