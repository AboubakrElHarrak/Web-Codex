            "paragraph1": "State space search is a process used in the field of computer science, including artificial intelligence (AI), in which successive configurations or states of an instance are considered, with the intention of finding a goal state with the desired property.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Problems are often modelled as a state space, a set of states that a problem can be in. The set of states forms a graph where two states are connected if there is an operation that can be performed to transform the first state into the second.\n",
            "paragraph3": "State space search often differs from traditional computer science search methods because the state space is implicit: the typical state space graph is much too large to generate and store in memory.  Instead, nodes are generated as they are explored, and typically discarded thereafter.  A solution to a combinatorial search instance may consist of the goal state itself, or of a path from some initial state to the goal state.\n"
