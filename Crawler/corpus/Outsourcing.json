            "paragraph2": "The term outsourcing, which came from the phrase outside resourcing, originated no later than 1981. The concept, which The Economist says has \"made its presence felt since the time of the Second World War\", often involves the contracting of a business process (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, facility management, call centre/call centre support).\n",
            "paragraph3": "The practice of handing over control of public services to private enterprises, even if on a short-term limited basis, may also be described as \"outsourcing\".\n",
            "paragraph4": "Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring (relocating a business function to a distant country) or nearshoring (transferring a business process to a nearby country).\n",
            "paragraph5": "Offshoring and outsourcing are not mutually inclusive: there can be one without the other. They can be intertwined (offshore outsourcing), and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, involving terms such as reshoring, inshoring, and insourcing.\n"

If the distant workplace is a foreign subsidiary/owned by the company, then the offshore operation is a captive,[12] sometimes referred to as in-house offshore.[13]\nOffshore outsourcing is the practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions (\"Outsourcing\") in a country other than the one where the products or services are actually performed, developed or manufactured (\"Offshore\").[14]\nInsourcing entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration.\nNearshoring refers to outsource to a nearby country.\nFarmshoring refers to outsourcing to companies in more rural locations within the same country.[15]\nHomeshoring (also known as Homesourcing) is a form of IT-enabled \"transfer of service industry employment from offices to home-based ... with appropriate telephone and Internet facilities\".[16][17] These telecommuting positions may be customer-facing or back-office,[18] and the workers may be employees or independent contractors.\nIn-housing refers to hiring employees[19][20] or using existing employees/resources to undo an outsourcing.[21][22]\nAn Intermediary is a business which provides a contract service to another organization while contracting out that same service.[23][24]\nMake or buy decision refers to an organization's decision whether to outsource a process or service or to deliver it itself.[25]\n",

            "subtitle1": "Motivations",
            "paragraph1": "Global labor arbitrage can provide major financial savings from lower international labor rates, which could be a major motivation for offshoring. Cost savings from economies of scale and specialization can also motivate outsourcing, even if not offshoring. Since about 2015 indirect revenue benefits have increasingly become additional motivators.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Another motivation is speed to market. To make this work, a new process was developed: \"outsource the outsourcing process\". Details of managing DuPont's CIO Cinda Hallman's $4 billion 10-year outsourcing contract with Computer Sciences Corporation and Andersen Consulting were outsourced, thus avoiding \"inventing a process if we'd done it in-house\". A term subsequently developed to describe this is midsourcing.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control by allowing organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It is often perceived to reduce hiring and training specialized staff, to make available specialized expertise, and to decrease capital, operating expenses, and risk.\n",
            "paragraph4": "\"Do what you do best and outsource the rest\" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first \"coined and developed\" in the 1990s by management consultant Peter Drucker. The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of \"Outsourcing\" as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal article entitled \"Sell the Mailroom\".\n",
            "paragraph5": "Sometimes the effect of what looks like outsourcing from one side and insourcing from the other side can be unexpected: The New York Times reported in 2001 that \"6.4 million Americans .. worked for foreign companies as of 2001,  more jobs are being outsourced than\" [the reverse].\n",
            "subtitle2": "Agreements",
            "paragraph6": "Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an exchange of services, expertise, and payments. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.\n"

            "paragraph1": "Following the adding of management layers in the 1950s and 1960s to support expansion for the sake of economy of scale, corporations found that agility and added profits could be obtained by focusing on core strengths; the 1970s and 1980s were the beginnings of what later was named outsourcing. Kodak's 1989 \"outsourcing most of its information technology systems\" was followed by others during the 1990s.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In 2013, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals gave recognition to Electronic Data Systems Corporation's Morton H. Meyerson who, in 1967, proposed the business model that eventually became known as outsourcing.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Growth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, although not universally accepted, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s. Services making use of low-cost countries included\n",

            "subtitle2": "Early 21st century",
            "paragraph4": "In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or offshore outsourcing. Other options subsequently emerged: nearshoring, crowdsourcing, multisourcing, strategic alliances/strategic partnerships, strategic outsourcing.\n",
            "paragraph5": "From Drucker's perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability. The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider's knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.\n",
            "paragraph6": "In 2009, by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Inflation, high domestic interest rates, and economic growth pushed India's IT salaries 10 - 15%, making some jobs relatively \"too\" expensive, compared to other offshoring destinations. Areas for advancing within the value chain included research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, and medical transcription.\n",
            "paragraph8": "Japanese companies outsourced to China, particularly to formerly Japanese-occupied cities. German companies have outsourced to Eastern European countries with German-language affiliation, such as Poland and Romania. French companies outsource to North Africa for similar reasons.\n",
            "paragraph9": "For Australian IT companies, Indonesia is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Growth of white-collar outsourcing",
            "paragraph10": "Although offshoring initially focused on manufacturing, white-collar offshoring/outsourcing has grown rapidly since the early 21st century. The digital workforce of countries like India and China are only paid a fraction of what would be minimum wage in the US. On average, software engineers are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the US and Canada. Closer to the US, Costa Rica has become a big source for the advantages of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, and similar time zones with the United States. It takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter & Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.\n",
            "paragraph11": "Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar workers can choose their working hours, and for which companies to work. Clients benefit from telecommuting, reduced office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are contracted workers.\n",
            "paragraph12": "However, ending a government oursourcing arrangement has its difficulties too.\n"

        {
            "title": "Reasons for outsourcing",
            "paragraph1": "While U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce high top level executive or managerial costs, they primarily outsource to reduce peripheral and \"non-core\" business expenses. Further reasons are higher taxes, high energy costs, and excessive government regulation or mandates.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Mandated benefits like social security, Medicare, and safety protection (OSHA regulations) are also motivators. By contrast, executive pay in the United States in 2007, which could exceed 400 times more than average workers — a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965 is not a factor.[citation needed]\n",
            "paragraph3": "Other reasons include reducing and controlling operating costs, improving company focus, gaining access to world-class capabilities, tax credits, freeing internal resources for other purposes, streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions, and maximizing use of external resources. For small businesses, contracting/subcontracting/\"outsourcing\" might be done to improve work-life balance\n"

        {
            "title": "Outsourcing models",
            "paragraph1": "There are many outsourcing models, with variations by country, year and industry.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Another approach is to differentiate between tactical and strategic outsourcing models. Tactical models include:\n",
            "ul1": "Staff augmentation\nProject-based\nTo gain expertise not available in-house.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Strategic consultancy includes for Business process improvement.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Innovation outsourcing",
            "paragraph4": "When offshore outsourcing knowledge work, firms heavily rely on the availability of technical personnel at offshore locations. One of the challenges in offshoring engineering innovation is a reduction in quality.\n",
            "subtitle2": "Co-sourcing",
            "paragraph5": "Co-sourcing is a hybrid of internal staff supplemented by an external service provider. Co-sourcing can minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control than fully outsourced.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Co-sourcing services can supplement internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information risk management or integrity services, or help during peak periods, or similarly for other areas such as software development or human resources.\n",
            "paragraph7": "Identity management co-sourcing is when on-site hardware interacts with outside identity services.\n",
            "paragraph8": "This contrasts with an \"all in-the-cloud\" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, cloud computing infrastructure.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Offshore Software R&D is the provision of software development services by a supplier (whether external or internal) located in a different country from the one where the software will be used. The global software R&D services market, as contrasted to Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) and BPO, is rather young and currently is at a relatively early stage of development.\n",
            "paragraph10": "Canada, India, Ireland, and Israel were the four leading countries as of 2003. Although many countries have participated in the Offshore outsourcing of software development, their involvement in co-sourced and outsourced Research & Development (R&D) was somewhat limited. Canada, the second largest by 2009, had 21%\n",
            "paragraph11": "As of 2018, the top three were deemed by one \"research-based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists\" as China, India and Israel.\"\n",

        },
        {
            "title": "Usability issues in offshore development",
            "paragraph1": "The main driver for offshoring development work has been the greater availability of developers at a lower cost than in the home country. However, the rise in offshore development has taken place in parallel with an increased awareness of the importance of usability, and the user experience, in software. Outsourced development poses special problems for development, i.e. the more formal, contractual relationship between the supplier and client, and geographical separation place greater distance between the developers and users, which makes it harder to reflect the users' needs in the final product. This problem is exacerbated if the development is offshore. Further complications arise from cultural differences, which apply even if the development is carried out by an in-house offshore team.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Historically offshore development concentrated on back office functions but, as offshoring has grown, a wider range of applications have been developed. Offshore suppliers have had to respond to the commercial pressures arising from usability issues by building up their usability expertise. Indeed, this problem has presented an attractive opportunity to some suppliers to move up market and offer higher value services.\n",
            "subtitle1": "Legal issues",
            "paragraph3": "Offshore Software R&D means that company A turns over responsibility, in whole or in part, of an in-house software development to company B whose location is outside of company A's national jurisdiction. Maximizing the economic value of an offshore software development asset critically depends on understanding how best to use the available forms of legal regulations to protect intellectual rights. If the vendor cannot be trusted to protect trade secrets, then the risks of an offshoring software development may outweigh its potential benefits. Hence, it is critical to review the intellectual property policy of the potential offshoring supplier. The intellectual property protection policy of an offshore software development company must be reflected in these crucial documents: General Agreement; Non-Disclosure Agreement; Employee Confidentiality Contract.\n",
            "subtitle2": "2000-2012 R&D",
            "paragraph4": "As forecast in 2003, R&D is outsourced. Ownership of intellectual property by the outsourcing company, despite outside development, was the goal. To defend against tax-motivated cost-shifting, the US government passed regulations in 2006 to make outsourcing research harder. Despite many R&D contracts given to Indian universities and labs, only some research solutions were patented.\n",
            "paragraph5": "While Pfizer moved some of its R&D from the UK to India, a Forbes article suggested that it is increasingly more dangerous to offshore IP sensitive projects to India, because of India's continued ignorance of patent regulations. In turn, companies such as Pfizer and Novartis, have lost rights to sell many of their cancer medications in India because of lack of IP protection.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Future trends",
            "paragraph6": "A 2018 \"The Future of Outsourcing\" report began with \"The future of outsourcing is digital.\" The \"\"Do what you do best and outsource the rest\" approach means that \"integration with retained systems\" is the new transition challenge - people training still exists, but is merely an \"also.\"\n",
            "paragraph7": "There is more complexity than before, especially when the outside company may be an integrator.\n",
            "paragraph8": "While the number of technically skilled labor grows in India, Indian offshore companies are increasingly tapping into the skilled labor already available in Eastern Europe to better address the needs of the Western European R&D market.\n",
            "paragraph9": "Forbes considered the US Presidential election of 2016 \"the most disruptive change agent for the outsourcing industry\", especially the renewed \"invest in America\" goal highlighted in campaigning, but the magazine tepidly reversed direction in 2019 as to the outcome for employment.\n",
            "paragraph10": "Furthermore, there are growing legal requirements for data protection, where obligations and implementation details must be understood by both sides. This includes dealing with customer rights.\n"

            "subtitle2": "Management processes",
            "paragraph2": "Globalization and complex supply chains, along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as voice over IP, instant messaging, and Issue tracking systems, new time management methods such as time tracking software, and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as cost estimation software.\n",
            "paragraph3": "The term Transition methodology describes the process of migrating knowledge, systems, and operating capabilities between the two sides.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In the area of call center outsourcing, especially when combined with offshoring, agents may speak with different linguistic features such as accents, word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension.\n",
            "paragraph5": "In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver E. Williamson wrote that the governance structure is the \"framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.\" Adding further that \"because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.\" University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.\n",
            "paragraph6": "Reduced security, sometimes related to lower loyalty may occur, even when \"outsourced\" staff change their legal status but not their desk. While security and compliance issues are supposed to be addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers, fraud cases have been reported.\n",
            "paragraph7": "In April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four Citibank customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.\n",

            "paragraph2": "Among problems encountered were supply-and-demand induced raises in salaries and lost benefits of similar-time-zone. Other issues were differences in language and culture. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.\n",
            "paragraph3": "According to a 2005 Deloitte Consulting survey, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy.\n",

From 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 US presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.\n",

Often the reason is to maintain control of critical production or competencies, and insourcing is used to reduce costs of taxes, labor and transportation.\n",

Eleven years later in 2014, the United States recovered 10,000 of those offshored positions; this marked the highest net gain in 20 years. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return.\n",
            "paragraph15": "The fluctuation of prefixes and names give rise to many more \"cross-breeds\" of insourcing. For example, \"offshore insourcing\" is \"when companies set up their own \"captive\" process centers overseas, sometimes called a Captive Service, taking advantage of their cheaper surroundings while maintaining control of their back-office work and business processes.\" \"Remote insourcing\" refers to hiring developers to work in-house from virtual (remote) facilities.\n",

According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.\n",

Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA, heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s.\n",

Just as the U.S. has a \"Made in U.S.A.\" program, other countries support products made in their countries as well. Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back.

Commonalities usually include: geographic, temporal (time zone), cultural, social, linguistic, economic, political, or historical linkages.\nThe term Nearshoring is a derivative of the business term offshoring. The hybrid term \"nearshore outsourcing\" is sometimes used as an alternative for nearshoring, since nearshore workers are not employees of the company for which the work is performed. It can also be a reversal, by contracting a development partner in a different country but in close proximity (same or nearby time zone), facilitating communication and allowing frequent visits. This is a business strategy to place some or all of its operations close to where its products are sold. Typically, this is contrasted with the trend to outsource low-wage manufacturing operations to developing nations (offshoring), and reflects a reversal of that trend. Sometime, the work is done by an outside contracted company rather than internally (insourcing), but unlike offshore outsourcing, the work is done in fairly close proximity to either the company headquarters or its target market.\n",

The attraction is lower-cost skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. These countries also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe as they are part of EU. For example, as of 2020 Portugal is considered to be the most trending outsourcing destination as big companies like Mercedes, Google, Jaguar, Sky News, Natixis and BNP Paribas opening development centers in Lisbon and Porto, where labor costs are lower, talent comes from excellent Universities, there's availability of skills and the time zone is GMT (the same as London).\n",

English language skills are the cornerstone of Nearshore and IT services. Collaboration by universities, industry, and government has slowly produced improvements. Proximity also facilitates in-person interaction regularly and/or when required.\n",
            "paragraph8": "Software development nearshoring is mainly due to flexibility when it comes to upscale or downscale teams or availability of low cost \nskilled developers. The nearshoring of call centers, shared services centers, and (Business Process Outsourcing) rose as offshore outsourcing was seen to be relatively less valuable.\n",
            "paragraph9": "The complexities of offshoring stem from language and cultural differences, travel distances, workday/time zone mismatches, and greater effort for needed for establishing trust and long-term relationships. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as remote insourcing were created to give clients more control in managing their own projects.

            "paragraph13": "On the other hand, an academic study by the London School of Economics was at pains to counter the so-called \"myth\" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore. One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes-based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a \"lift and shift\" approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.\n",
