            "paragraph2": "Normally, the term rule-based system is applied to systems involving human-crafted or curated rule sets.  Rule-based systems constructed using automatic rule inference, such as rule-based machine learning, are normally excluded from this system type.\n"

            "title": "Applications",
            "paragraph1": "A classic example of a rule-based system is the domain-specific expert system that uses rules to make deductions or choices.  For example, an expert system might help a doctor choose the correct diagnosis based on a cluster of symptoms, or select tactical moves to play a game.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Rule-based systems can be used to perform lexical analysis to compile or interpret computer programs, or in natural language processing.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Rule-based programming attempts to derive execution instructions from a starting set of data and rules. This is a more indirect method than that employed by an imperative programming language, which lists execution steps sequentially.\n"
