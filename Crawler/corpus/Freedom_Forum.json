The Freedom Forum is also the creator of the Newseum in Washington, D.C., which it sold to Johns Hopkins University in 2019.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The Freedom Forum was founded in 1991 when the Gannett Foundation, started by publisher Frank E. Gannett as a charitable foundation to aid communities where his company had newspapers, sold its name and assets back to Gannett Company for $670 million. Retired Gannett chairman and USA Today newspaper founder Al Neuharth took the money and the shell of the foundation and formed the Freedom Forum. Its mission was to foster \"free press, free speech and free spirit.\"\n",
            "paragraph3": "Neuharth's daughter, Jan A. Neuharth, is chief executive officer and chair of the Freedom Forum.\n",
            "paragraph4": "The Freedom Forum's CEO and chairman from 1989 to 2011 was Charles Overby, a former journalist and editor. From 2001 to 2011, he concurrently served as CEO of the Freedom Forum and director of the board of private prison company CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America. Under Overby, the Freedom Forum donated $5 million to establish the Overby Center at Ole Miss.\n",
            "paragraph5": "The financial losses of the Freedom Forum and Newseum led to criticism of high salaries and some unusual proposals.\n",
