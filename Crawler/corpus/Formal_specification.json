            "paragraph1": "In computer science, formal specifications are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools. These specifications are formal in the sense that they have a syntax, their semantics fall within one domain, and they are able to be used to infer useful information.\n"

            "title": "Motivation",
            "paragraph1": "In each passing decade, computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and, as a result, they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software. Established engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of creating and validating product design. Formal specifications are one such way to achieve this in software engineering reliability as once predicted. Other methods such as  testing are more commonly used to enhance code quality.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Uses",
            "paragraph1": "Given such a specification, it is possible to use formal verification techniques to demonstrate that a system design is correct with respect to its specification. This allows incorrect system designs to be revised before any major investments have been made into an actual implementation. Another approach is to use probably correct refinement steps to transform a specification into a design, which is ultimately transformed into an implementation that is correct by construction.\n",
            "paragraph2": "It is important to note that a formal specification is not an implementation, but rather it may be used to develop an implementation. Formal specifications describe what a system should do, not how the system should do it.\n",
            "paragraph3": "A good specification must have some of the following attributes: adequate, internally consistent, unambiguous, complete, satisfied, minimal\n",
            "paragraph4": "A good specification will have:\n",
            "ul1": "Constructability, manageability and evolvability\nUsability\nCommunicability\nPowerful and efficient analysis\n",
            "paragraph5": "One of the main reasons there is interest in formal specifications is that they will provide an ability to perform proofs on software implementations. These proofs may be used to validate a specification, verify correctness of design, or to prove that a program satisfies a specification.\n"
        },
        {
            "title": "Limitations",
            "paragraph1": "A design (or implementation) cannot ever be declared “correct” on its own. It can only ever be “correct with respect to a given specification”. Whether the formal specification correctly describes the problem to be solved is a separate issue. It is also a difficult issue to address since it ultimately concerns the problem constructing abstracted formal representations of an informal concrete problem domain, and such an abstraction step is not amenable to formal proof. However, it is possible to validate a specification by proving “challenge” theorems concerning properties that the specification is expected to exhibit. If correct, these theorems reinforce the specifier's understanding of the specification and its relationship with the underlying problem domain. If not, the specification probably needs to be changed to better reflect the domain understanding of those involved with producing (and implementing) the specification.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Formal methods of software development are not widely used in industry. Most companies do not consider it cost-effective to apply them in their software development processes. This may be for a variety of reasons, some of which are:\n",
