            "paragraph1": "In evolutionary computation, differential evolution (DE) is a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Such methods are commonly known as metaheuristics as they make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.\n",
            "paragraph2": "DE is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require the optimization problem to be differentiable, as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. DE can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even continuous, are noisy, change over time, etc.\n",
            "paragraph3": "DE optimizes a problem by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and creating new candidate solutions by combining existing ones according to its simple formulae, and then keeping whichever candidate solution has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem at hand. In this way the optimization problem is treated as a black box that merely provides a measure of quality given a candidate solution and the gradient is therefore not needed.\n",
            "paragraph4": "DE was introduced by Storn and Price in the 1990s. Books have been published on theoretical and practical aspects of using DE in parallel computing, multiobjective optimization, constrained optimization, and the books also contain surveys of application areas. Surveys on the multi-faceted research aspects of DE can be found in journal articles .\n"

            "paragraph1": "A basic variant of the DE algorithm works by having a population of candidate solutions (called agents). These agents are moved around in the search-space by using simple mathematical formulae to combine the positions of existing agents from the population. If the new position of an agent is an improvement then it is accepted and forms part of the population, otherwise the new position is simply discarded. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Formally, let \n\n\n\nf\n:\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n→\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} ^{n}\\to \\mathbb {R} }\n\n be the fitness function which must be minimized (note that maximization can be performed by considering the function \n\n\n\nh\n:=\n−\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h:=-f}\n\n instead). The function takes a candidate solution as argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the fitness of the given candidate solution. The gradient of \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n is not known. The goal is to find a solution \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {m} }\n\n for which \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\nm\n\n)\n≤\nf\n(\n\np\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf {m} )\\leq f(\\mathbf {p} )}\n\n for all \n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} }\n\n in the search-space, which means that \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {m} }\n\n is the global minimum.\n",
