Bauduin said that since he felt he lacked the brains to properly contribute to the open-source community, he wanted to contribute by launching a European event in Brussels.  Bauduin teamed up with Damien Sandras.\nThe team repeated the event.  The F (of FOSDEM) was added at the request of Richard Stallman.\n",
            "paragraph2": "The event has been annually in February since then, with growing numbers of visitors, talks and tracks. It is organized thanks to the help of many volunteers.\n",
