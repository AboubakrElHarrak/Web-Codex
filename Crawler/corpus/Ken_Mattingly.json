            "paragraph1": "Thomas K. Mattingly II (born March 17, 1936) is an American former aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, rear admiral in the United States Navy and astronaut who flew on the Apollo 16, STS-4 and STS-51-C missions.\n",
            "paragraph2": "Mattingly had been scheduled to fly on the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, but three days prior to launch, he was held back and replaced by Jack Swigert due to exposure to German measles (which Mattingly did not contract). Mattingly later flew as Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and made 64 lunar orbits, making him one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon. Mattingly and his commander from Apollo 16, John Young, are the only people to have flown to the Moon and also a Space Shuttle orbital mission (Fred Haise, his former training crewmate from Apollo 13, did atmospheric flight testing of the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests).\n",
            "paragraph3": "During Apollo 16's return flight to Earth, Mattingly performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the second \"deep space\" EVA in history, at great distance from any planetary body. As of 2022, it remains one of only three such EVAs which have taken place, all during the Apollo program's J-missions.\n"

            "title": "Early life and education",
            "paragraph1": "Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II was born on March 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, to Thomas Kenneth Mattingly and Constance Mason (née Clarke) Mattingly. His father, who had been hired by Eastern Airlines soon after his son's birth, moved the family to Hialeah, Florida. Aviation became part of Mattingly's life from a very young age; he later recalled that his \"earliest memories ... all had to do with airplanes\".\n",
            "paragraph2": "Mattingly was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Miami Edison High School in 1954, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University in 1958. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity (Epsilon Alpha chapter).\n"

            "paragraph1": "Mattingly joined the U.S. Navy as an Ensign in 1958 and received his aviator wings in 1960. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron Thirty-five (VA-35) at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia and flew A-1H Skyraider aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga from 1960 to 1963. In July 1963, he served in Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-11) at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, where he flew the A-3B Skywarrior aircraft for two years and deployed aboard USS Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n",
            "paragraph2": "While based at Sanford, a fellow officer of Mattingly's was assigned to a undertake aerial photo reconnaissance of a launch from Cape Canaveral and convinced Mattingly to accompany him on this mission, where they observed the launch of Gemini 3 (carrying Mattingly's future Apollo 16 Commander John W. Young) from the air. After finishing his second cruise, Mattingly was frustrated in his attempt to join the Naval test pilot school at Patuxent River since his cruise ended after the start of the class. However, he managed to obtain a place in the Air Force test pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base in California where future astronauts Edgar Mitchell and Karol J. Bobko were his classmates and his instructors included Charles Duke, his Apollo 16 crewmate, and Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., who Mattingly would command on STS-4.\n",

            "subtitle1": "Selection and training",
            "paragraph1": "On September 10, 1965, NASA began the selection process for the fifth astronaut group. From a pool of 351 applicants, NASA selected 159 candidates that met the basic qualifications that required that applicants must be United States citizens born on or after December 1, 1929, and no more than six feet tall. They were also required to have at least 1,000 hours of flight time in a jet aircraft. Mattingly had previously shown little interest and inclination to apply for the astronaut program, however, his views changed when at the Air Force Test Pilot School and his class was offered the chance to apply for either NASA or the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. Mattingly and Mitchell chose the latter and were rejected. The deadline for applying for the NASA group had passed, however one of their instructors was able to get NASA to accept their applications. On the interview panel the astronaut office representatives were John W. Young and Michael Collins, at that time in training as prime crew for Gemini 10. Mattingly would later recollect that he was \"perplexed\" by Young. Collins asked Mattingly how he felt about the F-104, to which Mattingly replied that he thought it was a \"fun aircraft\" but without worth in combat. Collins appeared to dislike the answer and Mattingly felt he had blown his chance. However, after the conclusion of the selection process, Mattingly was called by Deke Slayton with an offer to become an astronaut.\n",
            "paragraph2": "At the time of his selection, Mattingly had 2,582 hours of flight experience, including 1,036 hours in a jet aircraft. He also had a bachelor's degree in engineering or in the physical or biological sciences as required by the initial qualifications. From the 100 military personnel and 59 civilian candidates, NASA selected 19 astronauts to join the group.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Mattingly, a lieutenant in the Navy, was a student at the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, when NASA selected him as an astronaut in April 1966.\n",

            "paragraph4": "At first, Mattingly was part of the support crew for Apollo 8. Mattingly served as CAPCOM during Apollo 8's second television transmission and subsequent preparation for trans-Earth injection.\n",
            "paragraph5": "He then trained parallel with Bill Anders for Apollo 11 as backup Command Module Pilot, because Anders was going to retire from NASA in August 1969, and in case of mission delay, Anders would be unavailable.\n",
            "subtitle3": "Apollo 13",
            "paragraph6": "Mattingly's first prime assignment was to be the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. Three days prior to launch, he was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles (which he never contracted) and was replaced by the backup CM pilot, Jack Swigert. As a result, he missed the dramatic in-flight explosion that crippled the spacecraft. However, Mattingly played a large role in helping the crew solve the problem of power conservation during re-entry.\n",

            "paragraph7": "The swapout from Apollo 13 placed Mattingly on the crew that would fly Apollo 16 (April 16–27, 1972), the fifth crewed lunar landing mission. The crew included John Young (Commander), Mattingly (Command Module Pilot), and Charlie Duke (Lunar Module Pilot). The mission assigned to Apollo 16 was to collect samples from the lunar highlands near the crater Descartes. While in lunar orbit the scientific instruments aboard the Command/Service Module Casper extended the photographic and geochemical mapping of a belt around the lunar equator. 26 separate scientific experiments were conducted both in lunar orbit and during cislunar coast.\n",
            "paragraph8": "During the return leg of the mission, Mattingly carried out an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film and data packages from the science bay on the side of the service module. Although the mission of Apollo 16 was terminated one day early due to concern over several spacecraft malfunctions, all major objectives were accomplished.\n",

            "paragraph10": "Mattingly was named to command STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 27, 1982, with Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., as the pilot. This seven-day mission was designed to further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the orbiter's cabin and in the payload bay. These experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System experiment designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface electrical charge. This experiment was a pathfinder for the first commercial venture to capitalize on the unique characteristics of space. The crew is also credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the first operational \"Getaway Special\" (composed of nine experiments that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies). STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July 4, 1982. Mattingly and Hartsfield were greeted by President Ronald Reagan after the landing; Reagan recognized the pair, both graduates of Auburn University, as \"you two sons of Auburn\" in his welcoming speech.\n",
            "paragraph11": "STS-51-C, the first Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 24, 1985. The crew included Mattingly (spacecraft commander), Loren Shriver (pilot), James Buchli and Ellison Onizuka (Mission Specialists), and Gary Payton (DOD Payload Specialist). STS-51-C performed its DOD mission which included deployment of a modified Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the Space Shuttle Discovery. Landing occurred on January 27, 1985.\n"
