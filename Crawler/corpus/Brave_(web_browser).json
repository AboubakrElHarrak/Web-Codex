Brave is a privacy-focused browser, which automatically blocks online advertisements and website trackers in its default settings. It also provides users the choice to turn on optional ads that pay users for their attention in the form of Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) cryptocurrency. Users can then send contributions to websites and content creators, which support BAT in the form of tips along with the ability to keep the cryptocurrency they earned.\n",

            "paragraph1": "On 28 May 2015, CEO Brendan Eich and CTO Brian Bondy founded Brave Software. On 20 January 2016, Brave Software launched the first version of Brave with ad-blocking capabilities and announced plans for a privacy-respecting ad platform.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In June 2018, Brave released a pay-to-surf test-version of the browser. This version of Brave came preloaded with approximately 250 ads and sent a detailed log of the user's browsing activity to Brave for the short-term purpose of testing this functionality. Brave announced that expanded trials would follow. Later that month, Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode.\n",
            "paragraph3": "Until December 2018, Brave ran on a fork of Electron called Muon, which they marketed as a \"more secure fork\". Nevertheless, Brave developers moved to Chromium, citing a need to ease their maintenance burden. Brave Software released the final Muon-based version with the intention that it would stop working and instructed users to update as its end-of-life approached.\n",
            "paragraph4": "In June 2019, Brave started testing a new ad-blocking rule-matching algorithm implemented in Rust, replacing the previous C++ one. The uBlock Origin and Ghostery algorithms inspired the new logic, which Brave claims to be on average 69 times faster than the previous algorithm.\n",
            "paragraph5": "Brave launched its stable release, version 1.0, on 13 November 2019, while having 8.7 million monthly active users overall. At the time, it had approximately 3 million active users on a daily basis. Brave 1.0, running on Android, iOS, Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, integrated \"almost all of Brave's marquee features across all platforms\", according to Engadget.\n",
            "paragraph6": "In November 2020, Brave reported having 20 million monthly users, and, in September 2021, it passed 36 million monthly active users.\n",
            "paragraph7": "In March 2021, Brave built its search engine out of Tailcat, which it acquired earlier that year from Cliqz, a subsidiary of Hubert Burda Media based in Germany. Tailcat was designed to deliver search results without logging user activity or creating profiles.\n",
            "paragraph8": "In April 2021, Brave became the first browser to be added to the Epic Games Store. Public beta for Brave Search, Brave Software's upcoming search engine, was launched in June 2021. It is currently being developed.\n"

Brave Search aims to use its own independent index to generate search results. However, it does fall back to Google and Bing in cases where it cannot find results, although it claims this is done anonymously and still preserves privacy.[citation needed]\n",
            "paragraph3": "Brave claims it will eventually offer ad-supported free search as well as ad free paid search options. It hopes to explore bringing BAT revenue sharing to these ads in a similar fashion to the Brave ads platform.[non-primary source needed]\n",
            "paragraph4": "In October 2021, Brave Search was made the default search engine for the Brave browser users in the US, Canada, UK (replacing Google Search), France (replacing Qwant) and Germany (replacing DuckDuckGo and Ecosia). \n",

            "paragraph6": "Brave is planning to release a new wallet fully developed in house. This wallet aims to compete as a web based wallet with Ethereum API connections to websites. Much like competitors such as MetaMask, it plans to support multiple chains, NFT viewing and built in swaps through its \"Brave Swap\" aggregator.[non-primary source needed] Following their roadmap update, the base of this wallet can be seen in the Nightly release of the browser.[non-primary source needed]\n",
            "subtitle4": "Brave Swap",
            "paragraph7": "Brave Swap is an aggregator for cryptocurrency DEX's based on 0x. It lets users swap Ethereum tokens for other tokens from within the browser.

            "paragraph8": "All user data is kept private on the user's device and is not accessible by any third party. The browsing data is not sent to Brave’s servers, so only the user of the device can see the browsing data.  A research study analyzing browser privacy by Professor Douglas J. Leith of the University of Dublin reported that Brave had the highest level of privacy of the browsers tested.  Brave did not have, \"any use of identifiers allowing tracking of IP address overtime, and no sharing of the details of web pages visited with backend servers.\"\n",
            "paragraph9": "To prevent browser fingerprinting, Brave uses Fingerprint Randomization, which makes the browser look different to websites over browser restart, to ensure Brave's users can not be uniquely identified or tracked periodically by using browser fingerprinting.\n",
            "paragraph10": "On October 15, 2021, Brave announced a new privacy feature dubbed Debouncing. The new feature is designed to disarm bounce tracking, a method of Internet tracking through intermediary domains that load when users click on a link. Debouncing will automatically recognize when users are about to visit a known tracking domain and renavigates the user to their intended destination, skipping the tracking site altogether.\n",

            "paragraph12": "Brave Shields is an engine inspired by uBlock Origin and others, which blocks third-party ads and trackers, in a similar fashion to other extension based ad blockers. The advertisement blocking features are enabled by default. Users are given control to adjust ad blocking, script, and cookies settings in the Shields and Privacy section of the browser. As well as ads and cookie based trackers, Brave shields also protect against fingerprint tracking using a technique it calls \"farbling\", which allows each browser session to appear unique.\n",

            "subtitle8": "Brave Rewards",
            "paragraph14": "Since April 2019, users of the Brave browser can opt in to the Brave Rewards feature, which sends BAT micropayments to websites and content creators. Site owners and creators must first register with Brave as a publisher. Users can either turn on auto-contribute, which automatically divides a specified monthly contribution in proportion to the time spent, or they can manually send a chosen amount (referred to as a tip) while visiting the site or creator.\n",
            "paragraph15": "Users can choose to earn BAT by viewing advertisements that are displayed as notifications by the operating system of their computer or device. Advertising campaigns are matched with users by inference from their browsing history; this targeting is carried out locally, with no transmission of personal data outside the browser. In addition or alternatively, users can buy or sell BAT through Brave's relationship with Uphold Inc., a digital currency exchange operator.[non-primary source needed]\n",
            "paragraph16": "The first version of the micropayments feature, launched in 2016, was called Brave Payments and used Bitcoin. Advertisements were shown in a separate browser tab.\n",

            "subtitle1": "Tokenomics",
            "paragraph4": "Basic attention token's tokenomics are based upon a cycle between user, creator and advertiser. Advertisers must purchase BAT to show ads on the Brave Rewards platform (Brave facilitates USD based ad purchases, but will then buy BAT on behalf of the advertiser). These ads are then shown to the user, where the user then receives the bat spent on the ad (with a 30% revenue going to Brave). Users can then either resupply this BAT back to the market to be re-bought by advertisers, or they can choose to tip to creators using the \"Brave Creators\" platform, where the creators may then sell. Creators being hosts of websites the user has visited, or literal creators on platforms such as YouTube.\n",

Anthony concluded, \"Brave is an interesting idea, but generally it's rather frowned upon to stick your own ads in front of someone else's\". TechCrunch, Computerworld, and Engadget  termed Brave's ad replacement plans \"controversial\" in 2016.\n",
            "paragraph2": "In February 2016, Andy Patrizio of Network World reviewed a pre-release version of Brave. Patrizio criticized the browser's feature set as \"mighty primitive\", but lauded its performance: \"Pages load instantly. I can't really benchmark page loads since they happen faster than I can start/stop the stopwatch\".\n",
            "paragraph3": "In April 2016, the CEO of the Newspaper Association of America, David Chavern, said that Brave's proposed replacement of advertising \"should be viewed as illegal and deceptive by the courts, consumers, and those who value the creation of content\".\n",

They praised the speed, saying \"Brave is hands-down the fastest browser I've used this year on any operating system, for both mobile and desktop. Memory usage by the browser is far below most others, while website loading is far faster.\" They also said battery usage could be reduced by using the browser – \"With less strain on resources comes less strain on your device's battery life as well.\" However, they had concerns that the user base is still far below Chrome, and thus it may not be able to build out its ad system fully yet, saying – \"The browser will need more users, however, to truly build out its new ad system: while 8 million people is a good start, it will still need to compete with Google Chrome's billion-plus users.\"\n",
            "paragraph6": "In March 2021, The New York Times analyzed internet browsers and recommended Brave as the best privacy browser. Writer Brian X.

            "paragraph1": "In December of 2018, British YouTube content creator Tom Scott said that he had not received any donations collected on his behalf by Brave browser. In a tweet, he stated \"So if you thought you'd donated to me through Brave, the money (or their pseudo-money ) will not reach me, and Brave's terms say that they may choose to just keep it for themselves. It looks like they're 'providing this service' for every creator on every platform. No opt-in, no consent.\"  In response, Brave amended the interface with a disclaimer for each creator who hasn't signed up with Brave and promised to consider adding \"an opt-out option for creators who do not wish to receive donations\" and \"switching the default so users cannot tip or donate to unverified creators\". Critics stated that the system should be opt-in and not opt-out, that the disclaimer did not clearly state absence of any relation with the creators, and suggests that creator begun process of signing up with Brave.[citation needed] Two days after the complaint, Brave issued an update to \"clearly indicate which publishers and creators have not yet joined Brave Rewards so users can better control how they donate and tip\" and in January 2020 another update to change the behavior of contributions and tips. They are now held in the browser and transferred if the creator signs up within 90 days; otherwise, they are returned to the user.
